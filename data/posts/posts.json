I asked this voter the usual questions and he said he was both registered and had requested his ballot.\n\nFinally, I asked him if he was supporting Joe Biden. He paused and said he was unsure. Going off script, I asked him if there was any questions I could answer about Joe.\n\nHe was a supporter of Bernie Sanders in the primary. I replied that I was as well. He asked me what positions Biden had taken that are the same as Bernie. I quickly pointed out that he supports $15/hr minimum wage like Bernie had pushed for since 2016. He also favors of lowering the age of Medicare to 60, which is a step in Bernie\u2019s goal of setting the age to 0. Biden wants a public option, also a step towards single payer.\n\nI also noted that Biden has always been ideologically flexible. His voting record in the Senate was always in the exact middle of the party. A majority of Democratic primary voters supported single payer. Biden tries to move with the center of mass of the party. Biden is an excellent lower case democrat in that sense.\n\nFinally, he asked about Biden\u2019s plans for students. I actually didn\u2019t know either so I looked it up with him on the phone. We were both impressed to learn his plan is very progressive! He wants free public colleges and student loan forgiveness after 20 years.\n\nThe conversion ended with him telling me he was changing his vote from Trump to Biden!  I felt elated to have flipped a Trump voter. There are still open minded persuadable voters out there. Don\u2019t be afraid to go off script and try convincing voters with the facts. Go Joe!

        "content": "Now wait- you might say- orange man IS bad!\n\nI agree. I\u2019m totally on board with that! I think both political parties right now have policies that are a serious threat to individual liberties. On top of that, I think Trump as a human in general is not a great guy. \n\nHowever, (to my knowledge) this subreddit is supposed to be different than the rest of reddit, which is a total a political echo chamber.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to come to a place where there is supposed to be real political discussion, especially of libertarian ideals, and instead, be greeted by a top post on hot (at the time of writing) that has NOTHING to do with libertarian philosophy or even politics in general!\n\nWhen I come to r/libertarian I don\u2019t care that Trump said he had the biggest tower in Manhattan after 9/11. Awful thing to say. But it doesn\u2019t belong here! I can read that and a variety of other \u201cTrump Bad\u201d posts by going to r/all. What does Trump saying that have to do with libertarianism?\n\nI feel like leading up to the election this sub has gradually decreased in quality- and is slowly turning into the rest of Reddit, an obsession with Donald Trump.\n\nI don\u2019t have a solution, just a bit of a rant. \n\nIf anyone does want to discuss libertarian ideals, I\u2019ve been reading lots of Nozick lately, and am starting \u201cEconomics in One\u201d. Lots of interesting things in those if anyone wants to comment!",

When they put out candidates like Trump and Biden and have Pelosi and McConnell holding everything hostage while they argue over how many trillions  will be sent to everyone (from their own money) I'm at a loss. Help me formulate a good response to the naysayers. THAT should be the national campaign for the libertarian party right now.",

I don\u2019t give a fuck whether you think trump is a racist. You\u2019re not entitled to my vote. Why the fuck does it matter to your encamped political echo chamber circle jerk of where my vote goes. It\u2019s not \u201csplitting the vote\u201d. It\u2019s not \u201cenabling the other side\u201d. It\u2019s not \u201cthrowing my vote away\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s only \u201csplitting the vote\u201d because you uninformed and na\u00efve fuckstick can\u2019t imagine voting 3rd party let alone informing yourself on more than 2 options every election cycle. If your excuse is \u201cthe American people are not informed enough on 3rd parties therefore I will vote D/R\u201d, then YOU are part of the problem.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Should have put quotations around \u201ckeep a racist in office\u201d. This aught to cause some more controversy. Fucking bring it",

Not sure what it was about, it was only 3 or so questions, but still thought it was a good thing that there were more than two options. Feels like a step in the right direction.",

        "content": "In the 2020 New Zealand election held on 17 October, the libertarian and classical liberal party, ACT (Association of Consumers and Taxpayers), achieved a record high 8% of the total vote.\n\nThis results in 8% of the seats in Parliament (House of Representatives) being held by ACT.\n\nPrior to the election, ACT held 0.5% of the vote and just one seat out of the 120 total seats.\n\nDuring the last parliamentary term, bills would be passed 119-1, with the single ACT member of parliament the only voice opposing laws severely restricting freedom.\n\nThe major conservative opposition party, National, collapsed in a year where there were 3 different leaders, including one who kept a Trump MAGA hat displayed prominently in his office.\n\nAs a member of ACT, I'm proud of what we achieved this election, and the new reinforcements will be key voices to hold prime minister Ardern's Labour government to account.\n\nThere is huge momentum for libertarianism here, and I sincerely wish libertarians in other countries hold on to hope, because there are many of us fighting to preserve freedoms and choice.",

        "content": "If you support Trump, you aren\u2019t libertarian (I\u2019m serious).\n\nSo I\u2019ve seen 'libertarians' on YouTube, reddit, and twitter say that they will be voting for Trump and that \"Trump is more libertarian than the libertarian party.\"\n\nNow I understand the criticisms of the LP and a lot of them are valid. But to say that Trump is libertarian is laughable. \n\nSo I\u2019m going to go over Trumps term and point to policies which he pushed which are anti liberty and anti libertarian. \n\n1. The National Debt: \n\nDonald Trump is the worst president in history when it comes to the national debt. In 4 years, he added more to the national debt then Obama did in 8 and Bush did 8. Trump increased the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n2. The Second Amendment: \n\nTrump is anti second amendment, and so is the Republican Party. Trump passed the first gun control in decades which banned bump stocks. Trump hates the second amendment.\n\n3. The Patriot Act/NSA Spying: \n\nTrump claims he hates unwarranted surveillance yet he expanded the patriot act and extended it. Trump expanded it and can now spy on us since 2018. \n\n4. Trumps drone strikes:\n\nObama is known as the 'bomber in chief' which is true. But Trump has actually surpassed Obama in drone strikes and actually is the biggest drone striker in history. \n\n5. Trump didn\u2019t end the wars\n\nTrump didn\u2019t end the wars and has actually expanded them in different countries and added troops there. \n\n6. Hates Free Market capitalism \n\nTrump doesn\u2019t support capitalism and instead supports corporatism. He supported massive bailouts of corporations which increased the debt and kept failing companies afloat. He\u2019s a corporatist who supported the cares act, the biggest transfer of wealth in history. \n\nTrump is a fraud and libertarians should hate him as much as Biden.",
