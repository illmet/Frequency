Have trusted people stand up companies through which the money can be funneled (3 week old company, founded through a loan approved via the Coronavirus Stimulus bill, is now the center of medical supply distribution): [(5)](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/republican-fundraiser-company-coronavirus-152184) \u201cI don\u2019t want to overstate, but we probably represent the largest global supply chain for Covid-19 supplies right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are getting ready to fill 100 million-unit mask orders.\u201d [(16)](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/republican-fundraiser-company-coronavirus-152184)\n\n4.) Have the federal government sell, at a reduced price, its strategic stockpile to the new companies, run by your buddies.

Is it really to this point that we're going to have to have states deploy the national guard to protect their shipments and supplies and treat the federal government like the enemy?\n\nThis is no different from the Somalian government stealing food sent by the United Nations and cartels selling it illegally. [(11)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/10/aid-somalia-stolen-un-report)\n\nExcept in this situation FEMA is the cartels and the banana republic is the United States.\n\nAlso regarding Trump removing the watchdog overseeing the $2 trillion coronavirus bill? In 1998 the Supreme Court ruled line item vetos are unconstitutional. [(12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York)\n\nHis excuse? The Take Care Clause. And the Take Care Clause just says the President can't make his underlings do stuff that's against the law. It underscores that the executive is under a duty to faithfully execute the laws of Congress and not disregard them. [(13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution)\n\nIf you don't know what that's about, Trump wrote a signing statement (basically functionally a line item veto except the next President could undo it, but by then it'd be too late) into the stimulus bill that he was going to ignore the oversight provisions in the bill and do it himself. [(14)](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/03/trump-says-hell-ignore-key-oversight-provision-in-stimulus-bill-1/) Either way, the Take Care Clause makes it illegal. \n\nAccording to Bradley and Posner, since the president is actually obligated under the \u201cTake Care Clause\u201d to comply with the constitution, \u201cif the president believes that a statute violates the constitution, he has a constitutional obligation not to enforce it\u201d (Bradley and Posner: 358).[(16)](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1411&context=etd) The opposite also holds true (see citation 13).\n\n\nWorse? They specifically knew it would hit Democratic cities and population centers *hard* and they wanted it to. That's genocide, according to Mirriam-Webster - though undoubtedly a crime against humanity according to international law. [(18)](https://www.businessinsider.com/kushner-covid-19-plan-maybe-axed-for-political-reasons-report-2020-7)[(19)](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/01/trump-and-kushner-must-be-prosecuted-for-crimes-against-humanity/)\n\nOf course that's in addition to the genocide (even by International Law) he's committing against the immigrant detainees that are in ICE concentration camps with forced sterilization of women. [(20)](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/like-an-experimental-concentration-camp-whistleblower-complaint-alleges-mass-hysterectomies-at-ice-detention-center/) Mass hysterectomies. That's in addition to purposefully using industrial disinfectant that causes chemical burns and bleeding. [(21)](https://www.insider.com/report-detention-centers-use-disinfectant-causing-bleeding-and-pain-2020-6) And sexually assaulting detainees. [(22)](https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-guards-systematically-sexually-assault-detainees-in-an-el-paso-detention-center-lawyers-say) And letting COVID-19 run rampant through detention centers and not actually performing healthcare, falsifying records, and worse.

        "body": "The duopoly is because of the U.S.'s first-past-the-post system, which only allows two main parties to compete for a single seat and leaves other parties to be spoilers. That is the system we have, and voting third-party will not change that. It's not great, but that's what we got (and you're certainly welcome to join us at r/EndFPTP).\n\nA third-party vote would have been meaningful if our system had a majority-vote requirement, since that could prevent the two main parties from obtaining over 50% of all votes cast. But our system elects the plurality winner; a majority is not required. This means that there will be a winner in this election, and that winner will be from one of the two main parties.\n\nHowever, the Democratic Party has made inroads in getting ranked-choice voting implemented at the state and local levels (like in [Maine](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/politics/maine-ranked-choice-voting-supreme-court/index.html)), which is actually the best hope for third parties right now. In contrast, the Republicans have generally opposed ranked-choice voting, since they've benefited from the spoiler effect on liberal opponents.\n\nSo if you one day want the opportunity to make an impactful third-party vote, the best vote right now is actually for the Democratic Party.\n\nThis is not the election to cast a spoiler vote for president. Trump has caused far too much damage. You may be in a position that you and your loved ones would be completely unfazed by a second Trump term, but many other people are not. Your vote has an impact on them as well. Those people are suffering under Trump and will suffer even more greatly if he is reelected and no longer accountable to the popular will.\n\nIf there are third-party politicians running for local office, that may be an opportunity to help that third-party build up a \"bench\" of experienced candidates for later runs for higher office (and they may one day have a chance in light of the Democratic Party's efforts at spreading RCV). \n\nBut right now, liberals need to unite and elect Democrats to federal offices (presidency, House, Senate).",

There is a big difference. Trump has done that to many of the other government institutions, too. Because when he was running he said specifically he wanted to disband those institutions (Trump thought we should get rid of the EPA and the Department of Education entirely to save money, for instance). But regulatory capture has been the compromise.\n\nList of Departments I just know from my own research are effected (but not a comprehensive list)\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency: Andrew Wheeler (Coal Lobbyist) Previous appointee was Scott Pruitt, also a Coal Lobbyist, had to resign for using the position to give a bunch of money to his buddies.\n\nDepartment of Education: Betsy DeVos (Opposes public schooling)\n\nFederal Communications Commission: Ajit Pai (in the pocket of Broadcasters, wants to get rid of the FCC)\n\nUS Postal Service: Louis DeJoy (CEO who owns millions of dollars in USPS rival companies, trying to dismantle postal service)\n\nHealth and Human Services: Alex Azar.

And when the middle class gets squeezed- well that's the end of that. Glad you were able to afford better healthcare but I was slammed with 6000 dollar bill for surgery. Only way I could pay that (engineer here) on top of student loans was because I lived with my parents. And I too live in a completely \"blue\" state.

NO WAY anyone left of kavanaugh gets approved.\n\n5. republicans potentially control house, senate, presidency, and supreme court after nov 2020.\n\nbut, as it stands, dems control the house, will likely win the presidency, could gain the senate and at a minimum replace ginburg with a civil rights hero like her... maintaining status quo and maybe even get another nomination.\n\nlastly, i live in a completely red state.. i voted third party because i despise the two-party system... and my hillary vote wouldn't matter a bit... unlike the critical obama voters in the midwest that stayed home.\n\ni'm sure you don't mean this post to be as angry and divisive as it seems, but rather than blaming people with strong views that might find some of hillary's beliefs and deeds objectionable, how about being pissed off that relatively few people are benefitting from a two party system that serves itself first?\n\ndemocrats need to nominate candidates that will ***get people out to vote***, not party insiders and incestual brand names.",

        "body": "Trump would require at least 50 Senators to approve an appointee.  There are 53 Republican Senators, with one already announcing she won't approve a nominee before the election is decided.  Mitt Romney is an almost certain no, Lamar Alexander is a highly probable no, and several others are in close reelection campaigns where bending over and grabbing their ankles to assist Trump's rushed insertion isn't going to help them win.  If he tries to appoint a nominee without approval, Biden can justify removing them.  \n  \nFurther, he has two clear options to fix the issue: expand the court, FDR-plan-style, or contract it to the original 5 member size, with the law worded to give preference to dismissing Justices appointed by Presidents who lost the popular vote (removing Trump's appointments, and anyone GWB appointed in his first term).  He could then get another law passed re-expanding the roster to 9 and fill all 4 vacancies.  That requires admitting that the only rule that matters is \"I'm in charge, so I make the rules,\" but that's how Mcconnell is playing it, so no one has a legitimate right to whine about it.\n  \nI think the expansion to a larger court would be an easier sell: pitch it as lessening the ability of any one President to turn the Court sharply this way or that, and also point out how many cases the Court refuses to even review each year due to lack of time and opportunity, arguing that an expanded case load requires an expansion of the Court to allow it to fully serve its role.",

I have been through many election nights which were tense but none with that sense of dread days before.\n\nHistorically rhe candidates were not so polar opposite.  This election though a vote for Trump really is a vote for hatred.   In 2016 Trump supporters saw a candidate without political baggage and wanted to give him a shot and hope for the best.   I get that.   Now 4 years later we see what he broughtnto the table and it is a steaming pile of shit.   So now voters voting for Trump are not voting on hope,  but voting that they want more of his steaming pile of shit.  \n\nIt makes me feel like we are all lesser people for this.   This election is going to divide us more because the Trumpers are proud of their shit eating and they can't wait to give us more of it.    If you look at Trump in 2020 and come to the conclusion that is the future you want for yourself and for your society then I don't know how we progress from there. \n\nTuesday night is going to be tense.   Because this election sets the tone not just of the presidency, but of the people that make up this nation.  I want to believe more us are not shit eaters but I am preparing myself to see that we are.",

        "body": "As a person who studies the flow of information (I\u2019m an information sciences major), I would like to largely blame the media rhetoric for Trump\u2019s 2016 win. The only way for the Republican Party to stay in power is to convince people they actually care about them and when that doesn\u2019t work they either convince people not to care at all (aka don\u2019t show up to vote), intimidate people at the polls, and then try and throw out ballots. I don\u2019t believe that Trump even has the favor of half the country, it\u2019s just Trumpists are the loudest and Republican loyalists are being complicit. \n\nAt this point, the people who are still voting for Trump have put Trump on a god tier and there\u2019s nothing he can do wrong. His campaign left people in the cold? Not his fault. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019d like to point out the information seeking behaviors that I\u2019ve noticed of loud Trump supporter in my Facebook feed. They tend to only believe Fox News. Personally, I don\u2019t watch the news on TV anymore but I do sometimes keep their articles in my thread just to see how different sources are covering it. It\u2019s been uncovered already that Fox News is propaganda. I notice that when they decide which parts to cover. Most headlines are talking about how Trump is trailing in the polls and Fox News chooses to say \u201cthis black man supports Trump\u201d or something of the like. Fox News has been a key player in setting up this divisive stance. There\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re either with us or against us\u201d belief that they\u2019ve manifested, but it\u2019s turned into more than that. Trump has made it all about him. If you\u2019re a real American, you support him. If you don\u2019t, then fuck you and get out. His supporters have adopted this rhetoric as well. Supporting Trump means you\u2019re a God-fearing Christian and you love your country. Being a liberal means you want to take our guns, turn everyone gay, kill all the babies, and make us communists. \n\nAnother reason in which Trump still has supports is the way people view reality. There\u2019s an article from the Atlantic that describes their reality as climbing the hill of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d. I\u2019ll link it here: [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/white-men-coronavirus-trump-approval/616780/)\n\nI don\u2019t want to pinpoint a lack of education as a player. Because that\u2019s just a consequence of the underlying systemic issues. The US\u2019s infrastructure was built on oppression by race, wealth, and status. It picks and chooses who\u2019s on top and keeps people down on the bottom. Our capitalist state relies on sacrifice zones and wasted lives in order to thrive. We profit on prisons and coal mining towns. We repeatedly decide how much a life is worth. But that\u2019s all another issue, isn\u2019t it? \n\nIt\u2019s all fucked up and I\u2019m scared too. Let\u2019s just sit back and get drunk I guess.",

Between that and the fact that Trump lost the popular vote, we have a reality in which the POTUS was put in office by about ~62M voters, in a country with a population over 300M. \n\nSo it isn't as if half of Americans like him, it is that nearly half of Americans are too complacent to even vote.

You get the idea... It's where all actual life takes place. Even the actual commerce of the crops grown in rural areas is happening in the city. You live amongst other people, some like you, most very different and it works beautifully most of the time because everyone brings something different to the table. Teamwork makes the dreamwork. Yes there are some problems. But compared to....\n\nRural areas, or two-horse town, hilljack, cousin-fucking red counties as I like to call them, are food deserts, where the only place to get groceries or clothes is the Dollar General or a 2 hour drive to WalMart. Everyone knows your business and if you stand out at all you are ostracized by the other 50 people in your town. You have probably never been to the big city and probably never will because you're too scared. You can work at the aforementioned walmart or dollar general, casey's general store, the local prison, or if you're really lucky, a factory. You have a shit education from your one room schoolhouse. The xenophobic culture runs so deep that nobody from outside this incestuous petri dish of hate would ever want to move there from a city, not that you'd let them especially if their skin color is dark of all FUCKING THINGS. You feel like you're losing because you are. Just like your daddy lost in Vietnam and your grand pappy lost the civil war and that makes you angry so along comes Trump and suddenly you have a voice which unbeknownst to your simpleton ass is being exploited hard by a reality TV host for the power to stay out of court for tax evasion and God knows what other crimes...\n\nThe suburbs are a mix of this crap. Some commute to the city and the rest work in the suburb which is often only slightly better than deep Trump country. \n\nI sleep at night because when I read a fucking history book I understand a few things. Every time freedom and equality has been expanded to be more inclusive it has been a progressive platform that conservatives were dragged kicking and screaming toward. Slavery abolition. Voting rights for blacks. Voting rights for women. Gay marriage. Labor laws. On and on through history, actual freedoms that we now take for granted like entitled assholes, and are in real jeopardy of throwing away in 2 days, was fought for by pioneers. The ones against these ideas always lose. They always fucking lose eventually. So I hope that Trump has been just a dying gasp of longing for some kind ofade up nostalgic americana when America \"was great\" and will be again. But make no mistake, this orange fucking tyrant has and will continue to sell us out if we let him. Honestly, I think they relate to him because he is a loser.\n\nThank you for letting me vent.",

Plus I know the military generals are not overall happy with the president, but I can see elements in the military siding with Trump and enforce the overthrow of the democracy.\n\nFYI, if Trump wins due to the Supreme Court overthrowing state election boards, then the United States will break apart or turn into an empire since now we have a dictatorship.

If you are/were planning to vote for Biden, then Trump has just edged up by a vote.  I voted by mail in Utah, and when I checked the county clerk's website 3 days later, it had already been received.  I don't know what state you're in, but this website  [https://www.workplacefairness.org/voting-rights-time-off-work ] should tell you what the laws about workplace voting rights are in your state.  Please do whatever it takes to vote tomorrow.",

And an AR-15 is a fantastic hunting rifle hence its popularity. And for liberals to want to make it harder or impossible for those people to legally own guns is selfish and stupid. Raising taxes for everyone to pay for public schools and infrastructure in an unincorporated area is pointless in areas where there are nothing but dirt roads and homeschooled children because the closest actual school is 2 hours away. \n\nThe city dwellers influence the country dwellers much more than the other way around when it comes to the electoral college. People should be allowed to live their lives the way they choose, so as long as they aren't causing any physical harm on anyone else. That means having different fundamental values, which it seems to me the left wants to try and take away.",

Moreover, as a Muslim I\u2019m sure you know of all the hatred and calls for unprovoked, offensive violence against  non-Muslims in the Quran, specifically chapter 9 which was chronologically one of the last chapters \u201crevealed\u201d to him.  According to the well established abrogation principle of Islam, these chronologically later verses cancel out the chronologically earlier verses of peace and tolerance.  You seem like a person who has common sense so it\u2019s difficult for me to understand how you could follow such an objectively evil religion.",

Slave trading occurred among Christians as well so you can't say that's a Muslim thing specifically. The \"violence against non-Muslims\" was relevant to the time because there were tensions between Islam and Christianity, I believe. It is not relevant today. Groups like ISIS are not true Muslims. They twist what the Qu'ran says to fit their radical beliefs and make us look bad. I would never wish harm on non-Muslims. I live in the Deep South so there's not many Muslims here and I'm surrounded by Christians. We all respect each other. You also can't attack Islam for being \"evil\" when Christianity is also not perfect. You can't take something from thousands of years ago and believe that stuff is still relevant to modern society.",

Did Jesus engage in slavery?  No.  That is the appropriate comparison.  \n\nWhether it was common or not at the time for 50+ year old man to rape 9 year olds is irrelevant.  Any man, no matter what the time, that can look down at a child and get sexually aroused is a sick, sick person.  Disgusting.  Moreover, Muhammad \u2014 according to the Quran \u2014 is a perfect example for all time.  Not just for the time he lived.  Tensions with another group of people doesn\u2019t justify hatred and encouraging violence against them.  I have tension with liberals but I would never encourage violence against them.  I\u2019m glad you seem like a good peaceful person despite the teachings of Islam and the example of Muhammad, but that doesn\u2019t erase all the disgusting actions committed by him.  How do you reconcile your faith and your seemingly good intentions with the vile behavior of your prophet?  Do you condemn his evil actions?",

People who claim to be Christians have been just as bad as Muslims throughout history.  Buddhists have even been horrible.  All people from all religions have done bad things in the name of their religion.  Where Islam is unique, however, is that it\u2019s main figure and central prophet preached hatred, violence and intolerance and engaged in disgusting atrocities.  When a jihadist beheads an infidel, he is emulating and directly obeying the teachings of his religion.  When a Christian engages in crusades, or murder, or judges others he is directly disobeying the teachings of Jesus.  That\u2019s the difference.

Immediately after 9/11, Bush said, \u201cIslam is peace.\u201d Obama never painted Muslims in a single brush the way Trump did.\n\nYou\u2019re obviously blinding yourself to everything racist and evil that Donald Trump stands for to justify your conservatism. Even now, you\u2019re being used as a prop to show that Trump has some Muslim support. When you\u2019re a little older, you\u2019ll experience the racism and xenophobia that your parents probably experienced. That\u2019s probably one reason why your parents are supporting Democrats, in addition to their liberal beliefs.\n\nRemember when Trump claimed that Muslims were cheering on 9/11. That was a lie. Remember when he said that all Muslims should be put on a national registry. When he put out his Muslim ban, he didn\u2019t ban the one country which produced the majority of the attackers on 9/11 - Saudi Arabia. This wasn\u2019t about security; this was about preventing non-white immigration.\n\nTrump is Islamophobic.",

He can\u2019t ban all Egyptian immigrants because of that. Banning all immigrants that came from a country because of terrorism is nonsense. The actual solution to prevent future attacks is fighting against ILLEGAL immigration. Also, 9/11 was 15 years before the 2016 elections, and, as Trump said, he only ran for president because of Biden and Obama. The attacks were a lamentable tragedy, but obviously not the priority when Trump was elected.",

So that's good to read.  \n\n#5. is great. Good to read.\n\n#6 I can't read. I have to pay and subscribe. \n\n#7 is great that's he continuing the work of previous presidents. That's a difficult thing to tackle. \n\n#8! Again you need to read it. Doesn't show what he's done for coal in a good light. Plus increase in coal production isn't exactly something to boast about.

But he has always said to social distance, and when you can't to wear a mask. He could never mandate wearing masks because its not within his power to do so constitutionally. He left it up to the states to do what they thought was best, which is what should happen, and gave them all the support they needed. What made him look bad was after all the praise from lefty governors like Cuomo and Newsome, they thru him under the bus when too much attention was put on them for filling nursing homes with covid patients.

Fox News and conservative radio have more viewers/listeners so there is a voice/side for Trump. For someone like me if I want to hear from Trump and feel the non conservative media is biased, (which, conservative media is biased too), I can read his tweets or watch a rally and hear directly from him. Having done that, his rhetoric does not seem presidential and is aimed at disliking the other half of America. I want unity. \n\nFor policies, Trump hasn\u2019t shown a healthcare plan and if I weren\u2019t protected when the new Supreme Court overturns ACA I will go broke. They should have released a plan to counter ACA in the ten years since 2010 because a \u201cguarantee\u201d sounds scary right now when my life is at stake Graham just went back on his word about the court after saying we \u201ccould hold him to it.\u201d",

You blame Trump for \"disliking the other half of America\" while the dem side encourages riots, looting, racial and gender tension, demonizes people based on race (white privilege, white fragility). Wake up and actually realize what's happening around you. It's not Trump that pushes this radical divisive agenda, it's the democrats. If you want unity, it's honestly ridiculous to vote democrat.",

He told them to \"stand by\" which led them to cheer for him, obviously understanding it as support from him.\n\nHe later said he didn't know who the proud boys were, when they are considered one of the most dangerous armed group by the FBI. He would have heard of them had he attended intelligence briefings, but he prefers golfing and justifies it by saying \"I'm very smart\" which is narcissistic and irrational (being smart doesn't make you know everything).\n\nYou could argue that he misspoke, and admittedly later he \"condemned them\" by telling them to stand down. The problem is that statement did not have the coverage he could have during the debate. The White House was also unable to make an official statement. That is what everyone is criticizing. His stance on white supremacists is not official, when it should absolutely be. My take is he doesn't want to lose the votes from white supremacists, thus he cannot condemn them. Even Fox news is \"tired of it\".\n https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-reporter-slams-white-house-for-deflecting-white-supremacy-2020-10\n\nThat is what people are mad about. There are also instances where he sympathised with white supremacists leaders, but that's another story.",

I'd say not actually ending the wars yet is still strange. 200,000 iraqi civillians dead after an illegal and offensive war when politicians like Joe Biden knew they didn't have weapons of mass destruction there. \n\nMeanwhile in Afghanistan we just had our 19 year anniversary, fathers and sons serving in the same war, yikes. No more coporate media news on the ground either, no longer interested in covering what's really happening.\n\nIt came out at one point that soldiers were dishonorably discharged for blowing the whistle on the US for allying with warlords who had child sex slaves against the taliban.  In Afghanistan US troops have also been used to guard poppy fields because it's not just about taking oil or mineral resources that could have been taken by China, its about the supply of opiates (doctor prescribed heroin that is decimating the rural white population) for the sake of the pharmaceutical industry here.\n\nThe US is actively bombing 8 countries. Can you name them all? Under Obama our drones had 90% civillian casualties, according to our own militaries internal reporting. They gave a war criminal the nobel peace prize, incredible.\n\nIn Syria, after the US convinced Gaddafi to get rid of nuclear armament and then subsequently killed him, there are now open-air slave markets in a completely failed state.\n\nTrump has not gotten us into a new war, but Iran is understandably concerned that we stopped giving them their money in the Iran deal, and will drop their end of the bargain out of fear of ending up like Gaddafi. It doesn't really help tensions that we just assassinated their top general, lol.\n\nA bad guy, but he was also most well known in the region for fighting Isis.\n\nThis is beyond a partisan problem. It is not in either parties interests to spend so much on the military industrial complex, but every politician finds a way to justify it, with Bush and Obama being the most egregious. If you're a libertarian then take a stand against war because it's expensive as hell, $5000 per second in Iraq! And if you're a Christian then you should oppose it because you believe love and forgiveness are stronger than hatred and this tribalistic stealing of resources",

You say Trump pushes divisiveness while completely ignoring Democrats who push it 10 times worse and more radical. This was my main point. Take a look at politics or any other leftist sub, they are openly calling for violence, death threats for anyone who disagrees with them. Somehow I practically don't see that on a few conservative subs that exist on reddit.\n\nTrump is focusing on the country. If you haven't noticed Democrats went completely insane as soon as Trump won. All the insane accusations, impeachment, blaming, threats. Again, it's the Democrats who's been doing all of that.",

It would free up a LOT of businesses to remove healthcare costs for employees. There are abuses in the private healthcare system, I can tell you stories about that. It\u2019s worth exploring new options and I\u2019ve never seen a new plan/program from the GOP. It\u2019s just \u201cno\u201d to anything new. See the podcast I posted below for some interesting reporting on that. \n\nThey will try with Roe and after the \u201cyou can use my words against me\u201d from Graham which ended up not being true - the trust is gone about their \u201cword.\u201d \n\nObama didn\u2019t end the second amendment. Nor take away freedom of speech. And unless you make over $400,000 your taxes won\u2019t increase. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/planet-money/id290783428?i=1000495858692.",

Let's take a look.\n\n> Prosecutor Yarema seeks to investigate Hunter Biden & Burisma for corruption. \n\nNo.  Yarema was **NOT** investigating.  He was fired for **NOT** investigating.  The new leaders in Ukraine wanted to clamp down on the corruption that was rampant in the previous administration, and Yarema was not doing that.  So he was fired.\n\n> Joe Biden threatens to hold $1+ billion aid to Ukraine if Yarema is not let go. \n\nNo.  The Obama administration quickly made friends with the new Ukrainian administration (for reasons I haven't looked into and won't try to explain), and was in favor of the firing of Yarema because he wasn't doing his job.  Joe Biden couldn't withhold aid to stop an investigation, because no investigation was taking place.\n\n> Joe Biden then claims to have never interacted with Burisma ... but the emails show this is a lie? \n\nThe emails suggest that Hunter Biden was (allegedly, whatever) open to setting up a meeting with Joe.  They don't say whether or not a meeting was actually set up or actually took place.\n\n> Am I living in loony land, how is this not massive news?\n\nTwo reasons.\n\n1) The sourcing for the article is extremely questionable.  The FBI just announced they're investigating Giuliani and the sourcing of the emails because they think this was (allegedly, whatever) a Russian intelligence operation.  In other words, Russian intelligence hacked/stole/whatever these emails, and turned them over to Giuliani, who then gave them to the press.\n\nThe story that Hunter Biden gave his computer(s) to a repairman, who then turned them over to Giuliani is... um... pretty obviously bullshit.\n\n2) The content of the emails isn't actually that bad.  They don't say anything about an actual meeting taking place.  They also don't say anything about a meeting not taking place, but we can reasonably assume that there's no email that shows a meeting took place, because Giuliani would obviously leak that.\n\nNow, had a meeting taken place, would that be bad for Joe Biden?  Yeah, that looks bad.  But is at an OMG MASSIVE SCANDAL that sinks Joe Biden?  No.  Not even close.  Trump has been engaged in all kinds of garden variety corruption for the last 4 years; most voters don't care at this point, because there's more important things going on.  There's an article every week about Trump profiting in one way or another from being President that echoes around the liberal bubble for a few days and then disappears: \"Secret service spends $80,000 of tax payer money on golf carts at Trump Resort, blah blah blah.\"  People don't care.  They want a job and healthcare; the rest is just noise.\n\n> I had to visit Tim Pool's YT page and some Aussie Sky News site to see it. Huh? Is this not blatant censorship?\n\nYes, it's censorship.  Twitter, Facebook, etc are private platforms.  They're not bound by the same first amendment laws as the government i.; they can censor what they want.  For example, terrorist propaganda is posted to these sites all the time and quickly deleted.  I'm NOT comparing this story to terrorist propaganda, merely pointing out that censorship happens all the time on social media.",

This is BS but if you are considered about it, you should look at Trump who's nepotism is off the charts. Now whats wrong: Yarema had made no public statements about thinking about investigating Burisma. In fact this only came out AFTER he was fired. He infact was extremely corrupt himself and wouldn't investigate any companies while he was in his position. This is why Biden did what he did. He did what he did at the direction of Obama, our EU allies, AND REPUBLICAN SENATORS. So please tell me if every one of those people that directed Biden also had children working at that company who was not under any public investigation at the time.\n\nThis is a known Russian smear campiagn that Russian agents fed this BS to Rudy Giuliani (look at the new headlines about him). Rudy thinking that he had a hot lead built a team (many of whom are now arrested for illegally funneling money into donations) to try to get information about it. To assist Rudy, Trump dismantled the normal Diplomatic channels that would have stopped Rudy and pressured the Ukraine President to work with his personal lawyer to investigate his political rival. This is unheard of and criminal. \n\nNow what do these latest emails show that only conservatives care about? It shows that Hunter Introduced his business partner to his father. Thats about it. If you actually know whats going on, this is absolutely nothing.",

Trump was trying to legitimize an investigation into biden for his own personal interest.  No one but right wingers take conservative media rumors seriously.  So to get traction, its gotta be in the MSM. Zolensky makes an announcement of an investigation and the MSM reports it, it get legitimized.   Whether it was actually corruption or not was irrelevant, just the story of implied corruption coming from somewhere other than the conservative rumor mill. \n\nSteve Bannon talked about this strategy.  It failed. Trump got caught and was subsequently and deservedly impeached.  That's how I understand it.",

The General Prosecutor\u2019s Office initially investigated Zlochevskyi\u2019s alleged illicit enrichment, but shifted its investigation to that of a more minor offense, tax evasion, and eventually closed the case in 2016.]\n\nThe criminal case was closed exactly 1 week before Trump was elected (ie, when Biden was no longer responsible for Ukraine foreign policy). \n\nA corrupt businessman doesn't appoint powerful political figures to a board, and pay them generously, because they're kind-hearted. They serve a purpose, and it's not just for \"advice\". If that were the case, they could instead hire experts, with decades of education and experience.\n\n>\n[No one in the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office has been punished for the dumping of Zlochevskyi\u2019s case. No prosecutor or investigator has been found liable. The leadership of the office, which tried to cover up the dumping of the criminal case concerning Zlochevsky, resigned only under enormous public and diplomatic pressure.]\n\nLooks like no-penalty \"fall guys\", and everyone got rich, and the company is still operating as normal.",

Once you really start to look into both sides, it's very obvious that the left is corrupt and power hungry and wanting the American people to be reliant on them and everything they do wrong, they project onto the conservatives and point the finger blaming the right. As soon as you try to bring up any of the wrongdoing or power hungry corruption of the left, they shot \"covid19, over 200,000 dead\"... Just like the stimulus, they have tried pinning this on trump when hes been so desperately trying to get it passed when it's actually Nasty Nancy Pelosi who blocks every single bill as soon as it hits the table. Even CNN called her out on this. She does not care about the american people at all. The Amy Coney Barrett hearings were a great example. The Democrats attacked her family bc she has 2 adopted children from Haiti, and accused her of being racist and using the children. They blamed the attempted kidnapping of Gretchen Whitmer on the \"right extremists\", when it was actually an antigovernment anarchists. The media plays a huge part in this corruption and they use specific terms to sway your opinion. Like the Kidnapping attempt. The media says the perpetrators \"appear\" to be right wing extremists. The word appear signals that either they dont actually know, or they do know and are not being truthful. Over 90% of mainstream media leans left. So that doesnt help the situation either. You have Facebook and Twitter censoring and hiding the wrongdoings and corruption of the left and you also have google who held a company wide meeting after the 2016 election bc thry were \"so upset\" and changed their algorithm to provide a \"better quality governance and decision making\". So controlling what pops up when you Google a topic. I honestly could go on and on and on. This isnt even the tip of the iceberg. I didnt even bring up how BLM titles into all of this either. It's all about control. The left wants power and  control and will stop at nothing to have it and have the American people dependent on them. Trump is the opposite.",

If he would have encouraged the use of masks been a real leader and set guidelines for all states to follow, maybe not been a narcissist and stepped aside to let the experts talk, we would have a unified front. No one is saying there probably wouldnt have been people who died. And I agree that the numbers from China and Russia could be inaccurate. But there are plenty of other reputable countries that are high income countries like us, where the US has extremely higher death rates from covid and just general death causes.   Implying he knew more than scientists who study diseases and epidemics for a living, denouncing anything they said, specifically asked if people could drink disinfectant, spreading misinformation is deadly and he is the cause. And before the whole \"Fauci said no masks\" comes up, if you look at the whole picture, it was because the US didn't have enough PPE at the time, so Fauci was asking the public to save the actual medical masks and n95 masks for hospital workers. Lastly, one measly stimulus check did nothing in the long term. \n\nYou guys are the laziest mofos, there is mountains of evidence showing how inadequately he handled this virus and you call on people who dont support him to show you the evidence that you will only say is \"fake news\".  The travel ban from china just meant people flew to places like italy first before coming back, it made it harder to do contact tracing and harder to track and meant more spreading of the virus. \n\nAs someone who has lived with a chronic illness that meant I wore oxygen by age 22, a mask is literally the least amount you can do.

Also while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s look at the numbers for people who died FROM COVID vs the reporting of those who simply died WITH COVID. HUGE differences in numbers there. \n\nAnd while the disinfectant comment wasn\u2019t helpful, it also wasn\u2019t as bad as the media made it out to be. I watched the press conference at the time and it was blown way out of proportion. \n\nIf you think the travel bans didn\u2019t do any good, it would have been way worse if they weren\u2019t enacted. Most people don\u2019t have the money to fly half way around the world to try and get past a travel ban so that\u2019s a lame argument. \n\nSo if you have all these \u201cmountains of evidence\u201d show me something that\u2019s concrete where Trump endangered the population of the US. Fauci has stated numerous times in numerous interviews that Trump didn\u2019t say anything any differently than he was told from the experts at the time.",

However there have been dozens of reports that have come out where people have been counted in the COVID death number simply for testing positive for COVID at the time of death, but NOT dying from anything related to it. Such as someone dying from a heart attack with no COVID symptoms. Or a car accident or suicide and they tested positive for COVID during the autopsy.

That said, I find it hard to believe only because having medical issues means I talk to a lot of hospital workers, I can't imagine a hospital worker doing that to give their boss more money when they are already being shafted by their employers, and not particularly happy with hospital administration, if that makes sense. \n\nAlso my mother died unexpectedly this year, its super expensive to get an autopsy done when there is no suspicion of foul play, so again  highly doubt there are a bunch autopsies being done to try to give someone a covid death. And so you know, my mother had no covid on her death certificate. \n\nLastly, dozens of reports over our whole country won't be adding a lot to the covid death count. Its not like that would account for 100,000 deaths, maybe a few hundred max. But again, highly doubt it. \n\nI would like to see overall deaths for all countries regardless of cause just to see the true toll of covid this year for everyone, not just US.",

I tried to find where I had seen those numbers but was unable to do so. However I did find this from the BBC that shows how the US has actually done pretty well compared to the rest of the world. [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-53780196) Those trying to say Trump has totally failed the US in how this has been handled is truly incorrect when you look at the statistics.

Two of my least favorite qualities in a person are being narcissistic and a bully. I have found Trump highlighting both of these qualities to an extreme reach the last couple of years and has lost my support because those don't represent what this country should be.

The election, which pitted Republican Ulysses S. Grant against Democrat Horatio Seymour, was crucial. Republicans would continue programs that prevented Southern whites from gaining political control in their states. Klan members knew that given the chance, the blacks in their communities would vote Republican.\n\n> Across the South, the Klan and other terrorist groups used brutal violence to intimidate Republican voters. In Arkansas, over 2,000 murders were committed in connection with the election. In Georgia, the number of threats and beatings was even higher. And in Louisiana, 1000 blacks were killed as the election neared. In those three states, Democrats won decisive victories at the polls.",

I am very thankful we haven't actively engaged in many overseas battles while Trump has been in office.

They're (china) giving their subsidies to solar and wind, batteries while still giving subsidies to oil and gas and it that isnt even profitable at this point.

Rich white stock holders benefited under Reagan. Communities of color continued to slip into poverty. \n\n3) Yes Reagan was a Republican. So was Lincoln. The modern day Republican party would vehemently oppose both Lincoln and Reagan. Among other reasons the modern day Republican party would not jive with Reagan's stances on gun control at all. \n\n4) Ronald Reagan fucking sold out Iranian hostages to get elected. It's called the Iran-Contra and it's one of the most notorious scandals in presidential history.\n\n5) Obama was by every metric \"better for the economy\" than either Republican administration before or after him\n\nWe could fix so many problems in this country if Republicans stopped making decisions on government based on who's the fucking loudest on TV.",

        "body": "So, if I were to provide you with some instances where Donald Trump has lied, you would no longer find him credible? Or even the conservative media? My intention here is not to defend or attack one particular side. It\u2019s more to attack both. I\u2019m hopeful that people stop seeing sides altogether but that\u2019s no easy feat. The liberals calling the conservatives cultists or sheep are basically just cultists and sheep and vice versa. Seek out as much information as you can and learn to identify when you\u2019re being mislead or lied to. Challenge your pre-conceived notions and see if they hold up to scrutiny.  Nobody\u2019s hands are clean in the media. It\u2019s a business like any other and their goal is not to be fair or balanced, it\u2019s to sell adds. The key to filtering out fake news is to DIVERSIFY YOUR SOURCES!\n\nThe reason I stopped supporting the Republican Party is because I started to see them as solely an opposition party. I still hold many of the same values I did when I was younger but the party didn\u2019t do enough to convince me they cared about the same things I do. They spent most of their time simply opposing whatever the Democrats wanted to do. It\u2019s easier to just attack, criticize, point fingers and hurl insults than to come up with an idea that can compete with your opponent. Black lives matter? Blue Lives Matter! Happy Holidays? War on Christmas! Someone on reddit is a moderate but doesn\u2019t agree with me on Trump? Call them a libtard, accuse them of being fake news and then pour into their inbox with a bunch of nasty messages. It\u2019s easier than having an intelligent conversation or challenging ourselves.\n\nI wanted healthcare reform after Obamacare. The GOP did too. But instead of actually coming up with a plan, they\u2019ve only pretended to have one, then spent all of their energy trying to dismantle the current system and show how flawed it is, impacting American lives. They claimed to have a better option but 4 years after Trump was put in office, nothing is better.\n\nI wish Paul Ryan hadn\u2019t retired but I respect him for it. I thought he was going to be the person to pull the Republican Party back into the forefront of American politics. I might\u2019ve liked Rubio even more. Too many sitting republicans who opposed Trump at first chose their career over conscience. \n\nOP, if you honestly can say that you feel like you made a well informed decision and that\u2019s why you support Trump, that\u2019s awesome. I may not agree with your conclusion, but we really don\u2019t need to agree. I\u2019m happy just to know that you cared enough to have challenged yourself. America can still be a diverse and well functioning global power if we disagree on major issues, but not if we\u2019re a population who\u2019d rather fight amongst ourselves than try to be reasonable.\n\nI\u2019ll try to close with an olive branch. Country over party. Track money in politics. Fact check all media sources and politicians. Hold people accountable to their word. Remain open minded. Prosecute all corruption, none of this \u201cbut they got away with it so we should too\u201d bullshit. If you hate the Clintons for Bill\u2019s history with women, hate all politicians who have have been credibly accused of rape, sexual assault, lewd behavior, bribery, and just plain old corruption. If you really want to \u201cDrain The Swamp\u201d, first locate the swamp. It\u2019s not sitting under the Democratic Party, it\u2019s under all of Washington DC.\n\nTLDR; both parties have devolved into groups of bullshitters and manipulators. All media is biased so the best thing to do is consume from as many sources as possible and contrast their content. Always keep challenging your opinions - if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll never gain any perspective. Stop the division of America.",

Obama was better for the economy? A monkey could have done a better job. Obama and Clinton sold our economy to China. Your arguments are the stupidest thing I\u2019ve heard and I think I lost a couple IQ points reading that crap.",

It's beautiful here and over the last few years I've seen so many Californians move here for quality of life and lower taxes. The taxes in California seem ridiculous from what I've heard. Is it because of the movie and TV industry? I've heard of a mass exodus of people from LA to Texas and other states since COVID for those reasons. \n\nWith the states we're in, I guess our vote for president is moot because they're democrat strongholds. But since COVID I've also been realizing the power of local governments since Trump has threatened our states with withholding funds because of our governors. Another reason I'm fading from Trump is I don't think he cares about the west coast because he knows they will vote blue",

He does supposedly have a retirement fund but that is a diversified investment, probably has had oil and gas in there as well.

You trust that guy more than the guy who's released 15 years of his taxes, and has been in the public spotlight for more than 40 years as a congressman and then senator, and was known as one of the poorest senators. Biden did end up making some money supposedly, but that came from book deals and speaking.\nIf I remember correctly, there used to be an annual report that the president had to sign off on about the state of climate. in 2018 Trump said he didn't believe the report and since then we haven't heard of a new report ever being produced or made public. Trump also approved the drilling in the Arctic for obsolete oil reserves and we don't need simply just risk doing more damage to the environment, sold off part of bears ears national Park to oil drillers, and approved keystone XL pipeline. Trump also sidestep environmental review requirements to build his stupid wall that put at risk a number wild life habitats, monarch butterflies for example have been in a massive decline. Note this is not from msm, I very strictly stick to it well accredited scientists. \n\nTrump also is allowing greater use of herbicides that have been shown to be causing massive declines in the bee populations and cause cancer inn children, and has eliminated most regulations with regard to where and how they can be used. \n\nTrump also canceled regulation of methane output from oil wells, I wonder how much of that is part of what's causing all these fires in Los Angeles. I'm going to face looked into it but we know methane is highly flammable and it's being pouring out of oil wells and la has a lot of oil wells",

Deficit was going down under Obama, projections were that it would have been closed by 2020 if I remember correctly.\n\nIm in red state with a pro Trump governor, not california. \n\nI don't want to defend every accusation of racism against Trump, but  closing the border to china was half assed, there was a major outbreak of covid in Italy at the time trump closed the boarder with china, but I don't want to argue hindsight, yeah we could of done a lot better had we known what we know now. Whatever decision he made early on was luck. \n\nWhy I consider trump a facist:\n1) fired ethic officer in white house, did follow proper procedure to replace with next in line, he some one way down the chain l, probably found the first trump supporter in line\n2) fired inspectors generals, even those investigating those in his cabinet, not letting them complete their investigations\n3) fired cares act inspectors general, and mnuchen did not report to congress where he gave out cares act money to as he was required in the bill\n4) has said numerous times, he should get a third term or president for life.\n4) cohen, trumps former fixer lawyer said he wants to be president for life.\n5) used tax payer dollars and white house for gop convention which is illegal , but he fire everyone who would hold him accountable. \n6) bar is not after like the people's lawyer but trump personal lawyer paid for by my tax dollars\n7, 8, 9 \n\nI could keep going, but it is just so depressing.",

Neo-nazis and confederate sympathizer march with Trump supporters. They vote for Trump. I probably won\u2019t change your mind but I think it\u2019s important that we get our facts straight.\n\nThe reason white supremacists have taken refuge in the modern GOP is because of Nixon\u2019s Southern Strategy. Most of us learn about it in the 10th grade. I strongly encourage you to look it up, because as it stands you\u2019re blindly supporting a political party without examining a core aspect of its modern platform",

So many dead.\n\nDo I think he should have brought in draconian measures of complete lockdowns, mandatory mask laws, Covid curfews?\n\nNo actually, I don\u2019t think he could have nor has the power to implement them. \n\nBut I *do think* he could have gotten up and told his people the truth, he could have listened to the researchers and encouraged masks, social distancing, preventative measures and helped each state with their individual plans. \n\nHis policy on a border wall? What a joke. The money wasted on that promise for a big fence that falls over in the wind.\n\nPulling troops out without an exit plan?\n\nAttacking a military target with a drone just to show it could be done? Granted the guy was a big deal and an enemy but the fallout on that was from most perspectives not worth it. Who knows though, maybe it prevented a war (it seemed like it almost started one though).",

Yes.

If it were to ultimately be proven that he\u2019s committed any sort of tax fraud or questionable business deals with foreign entities as a businessman I\u2019d think any American would be suspect of his motives and lose trust in him, not just Democrats.",

        "body": "2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): \u201cIt has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don\u2019t do this in an election year.\u201d \n\n2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): \u201cIf an opening comes in the last year of President Trump\u2019s term, and the primary process has started, we\u2019ll wait to the next election.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president\u2019s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): \u201cThe very balance of our nation\u2019s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): \u201cA lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn\u2019t be denied a voice.\u201d \n\n2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): \u201cThe campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): \u201cIn this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.\u201d \n\n2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): \u201cThe Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): \u201cI think we\u2019re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): \u201cI believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn\u2019t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it\u2019s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.\u201d\n\n2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): \u201cI strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d  Mitch McConnell, March 2016",

McConnell should have said that he wouldn\u2019t accept any new nomination to the senate only because of the precedent he set (or if you want to be fair the ruling the Biden came up with). 4 years ago when I heard this I thought this is fucking stupid rule but fuck it. I\u2019m not gonna protest because it just gives voters more ambition to vote for the next president. Now it is a clear attempt on the republicans side to try and get control no matter what.\n\nIt is also aggravating that McConnell didn\u2019t even wait a day or two to announce that he would accept new picks but within an hour of hearing RBGs death.",

To be excited to vote for someone that you thought would do good for our country. I know what it's like better than a lot of the people here.\n\nI personally decided to vote against Trump last year when they impeached him. I knew then that being with Trump was being on the wrong side of history. I was disappointed. Frustrated with how things turned out.\n\nI voted for Joe Biden during the primaries. Back then I wasn't sure about him, but now I can't be more sure! When I decided to support Biden, I at least wanted to do some research on him. It was then that I learned how caring Biden is, how kind he is, how he has morals and respect and thoughtfulness and integrity.\n\nThank you for realizing what Trump is and how incompetent he is. Stick around this sub, if you'd like. If you can't stand the left wing posts, that's okay! We're just glad we can count on you to make a difference in November.\n\nGod Bless America!",

He's a Scranton kid who lives just across the border and was recently teaching at Penn in Philly.\n\nTry to convince your Trump supporting friends.

It must have taken a great deal of reflection and courage. \n\nFrom your post I can see you don't share much much ideology with Biden or the democrats (btw putting country over party is Another thing we need more of). And that's not a bad thing. The democrats aren't perfect and won't always be right. This country needs people with different views coming up with different ideas. \n\nI'm happy to have you on our side,even if just for this election. We need you. If you are up to it, how would feel about phone banking in PA for Biden? I think you could reach people who dyed in the will democrats couldn't.

All that time, I\u2019ve only respected the dems more and more. \n\nI dunno if I\u2019ll vote dem forever, and I\u2019d like to think if a Mitt Romney-esque candidate came around again, I\u2019d give him/her a fair chance of earning my vote.

Checks and balances doesn\u2019t exist under Trump and Congress is clearly suffering, they\u2019re all sheep and he\u2019s keeping them right where he wants them to be. \nIt\u2019s gonna be close to impossible to help your QTards as I\u2019ve seen with my own mother, so in that journey I wish you good luck!",

They only campaign and fund raise on them. \n\nI've been lucky. I've been able to travel the country and the world a bit. I've been to 32 states and 12 different foreign countries. I've lived in 6 different states. I've learned there are shades of red (Montana is red, South Carolina in crimson). I've also learn the democratic party, comparatively, isn't very left wing at all. Different experiences like seeing more of the world does help you grow.\n\nI understand that people evolve over time. People don't always recognize the writing on the wall at the same time. In fact I'm sure there is someone here wondering why it took me all the way to 2000. \n\nI'd advise some continued introspection. trump very likely played to some dark baser instincts. If you can identify that, you can probably help your friends. \n\nI'm probably older. By the time trump became a candidate, I was familiar with the total ass-hat he's always been.

After knowing what I know and seeing how horrible the trump admin treats people and how corrupt every aspect of this administration is, there\u2019s really no way i could vote for him and sleep at night.  Trump\u2019s handling of covid-19 and black lives matters was just the cherry on top. \n\nI don\u2019t think either candidate is perfect but I think Biden at least is a decent man who has experience in politics and tries to help people. We need to at least have him as president to get some of these corrupt politicians out of there. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re still bringing people over from the trump train.

However, this year I'm not voting for my congressional candidate because he is an unpalatable hack. President is usually an easy decision for me. The hardest was probably Romney but that was less about Obama and more about the gridlock and increasing polarization. I don't know if Romney would have fixed that, but a lot of personal animosity I feel towards Republicans wouldn't be there because they wouldn't have done that shit to Romney.",

They are very deep in it despite being anti-trump in 2016 only starting post these crazy conspiracy theories recently this year. \n\nThey believe every democrat is evil and many things I refuse to say out loud because it's simply ignorant and wrong. They also believe aliens run the government and only dear leader Trump can save America despite reality being to the contrary. They ignore protocol for COVID-19 social distancing and even have massive parties where they don't wear masks because thats what Trump does at his rallies. \n\nI worry for them and their children and I hope that they follow in your footsteps and eventually see reality for what it is. Thank you for sharing your story and giving me a little hope.",

I have friends who I cannot be around anymore because they are all-in for Trump no matter what. We see him trying to rig the election by cheating with sabotaging the USPS and in every way possible- how is that ok with anyone? Even his base? DISGUSTING. I try everyday to understand why anyone, except the very wealthy, would support him. I could go on, but just thank you.",

I think he only cares about himself, his own power, and his image; not our country. We now know that he deliberately lied about Covid, probably to protect the stock market and his presidency. We know he said awful, immature, and disparaging things about McCain and a goldstar family in the past. This all makes the accusations that he insulted our soldiers very believable. Also, Trump's attempt to unilaterally ban Tik Tok and other phone apps really bothers me. I don't care about Tik Tok itself, but the idea that he could just sign a piece of paper and tell all of us which programs we can and can't use on our own private property is just not acceptable. Every individual should be free to make the choice to risk their own personal data if they want to.\n\nIf Trump feels that it is a matter of national security, he can just order it banned on government worker's phones, and mind is own business in regards to what private citizens do with their own private property. Then there is also his open embrace of ridiculous conspiracy theories; knowingly pushing lies onto the American people to serve his own political interests with complete disregard to the damage it is doing to society. He also regularly re-tweets posts from known white supremacists and open racists. He even literally tweeted a video of one of his supporters shouting 'white power'. I think that anybody who supports Trump at this point either agrees with these awful things, or they are just lying to themselves about him. I also don't think his 'jokes' about being President for more than two terms should be taken lightly. We need this guy out of office.",

You've convinced me there probably are more people than I think quietly willing to change their mind and just not brave enough to go against their social group and talk about it.\n\nHope you do discuss it with others who may feel the same or be at a breaking point and inspire them.

When you look at the 29% of latinos who voted for trump, it can't all be pinned on Cubans. A lot of those were more of a vote agaisnt Hilary.\n\ntrump didn't bring back the jobs to Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania in the % he said he would. Wall wasnt built, ACA wasnt repealed.\n\nThose voting for him are the ones who are stuck in the cult mentality",

Western Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc all do better on pretty much every objective quality-of-life metric.

Especially on a day when my morale was low.\n\nI imagine i'm not alone: I haven't been sleeping, the news seems uglier than yesterday, my kids are stressed and cooped up, work is at a high stress point (though i'm lucky to be working), and i wake up to my wife in tears because we had just lost a family member. That's all on top of those bigger things happening in the world that regularly erode my faith in humanity or democracy. Not stating that for sympathy - stating for context. I bet a lot of people, especially here in the US, are in a similar situation and have it way worse than me...\n\n...and it really is heartening to see people thinking and talking and growing and considering and sometimes changing.\n\nNot to get grandiose, but I really, truly believe, no matter where you sit on a political, social, or religious spectrum- the vast majority of people want to do what is right, what is best for themselves, their families, their communities. Anyone can make a mistake on something big or small... it's how we learn from our actions that really counts. I think that \"stupid\" never considers that it's being stupid. Stupid people don't learn from their mistakes, they double down on them. Smart people have all sorts of differing opinions. Smart people can make mistakes and own them.\n\nAs a kid I bought into what I thought was an important core value to how the US works: we don't have to agree all the time- but if we work together (dare I say: compromise) we are smarter, better, and stronger. Lately it's been really hard to see how we, as a country, continue to function the way we're supposed to with all the constant hyperbolic vilification of any person or group with different views and the insane levels of fanaticism I see (currently, and especially, for Trump)...\n\n...but reading your post & a lot of the thread... man, this has been like taking in a gulp of air after feeling like I've been suffocating.

I DONT FUCKING KNOW!\\`  \n\n\nedit: against Trump I would vote for Jill Stein if I had to, but Im thinking in a normal election. Say vs Romney in 2012 or McCain in 2000, HW in 88.",

I really hated Bush and the Iraq War, I'm also very pro-gun, and was really turned off by both parties. The first election I could have legally voted in was 2012 and I didn't bother, in fact I didn't vote at all until 2016.\n\nI liked that Trump attacked Bush during the Republican primaries, but that he also seemed to support the main issues that I cared about, which were guns and abortion. I didn't really have strong political beliefs about anything else, but when I would talk to other people on the_donald, I'd end up just adopting what they thought about things, and by the time of the 2016 election I pretty much agreed with Trump on everything. \n\nI got really sucked into Alex Jones and Qanon and the like because I think it helped me think I was really smart to know all these things that normies didn't know about, or were too stupid to figure out. I boosted my self-esteem, I got out slowly over the last year really, Qanon predicted all this stuff would happen that never did, at some point I made a question about it on a forum and was immediately banned. That made me question if these people were really as open minded as I thought they were. \n\nEven after I left Qanon I still supported Trump for a bit, I think mostly because it was part of my identity at that point. I unplugged from social media though when it came to politics, and I think that more than anything allowed me to sort of clear my mind and think for myself more, opposed to always having a point of view reinforced constantly. That's when I really tried to examine how I thought Trump was really doing at the job, and I found that it made a lot more sense to me that he was really just using the presidency for his own personal gain opposed to having any grand plan to save America.

I was convinced Obama was too fresh and new to be able to take the presidency on and do a good job, especially considering the state of the economy at the time.  He was just way too inexperienced I had thought.  In the end, even though I didn't like every policy or decision I think he did a fine job with what he was given.  I voted for him in 12.\n\nI nearly protest voted for Trump in 16, but ultimately decided that was a terrible idea for me, my kids, and my wife and voted Hillary.  I was like you in a way, I trolled Hillary supporters leading up to the election.  I look back on that and cringe, I was a \"useful Idiot.\"\n\nIn retrospect I am looking back and realize that Hillary like a lot of prominent Dems are victims of a lot of targeted propaganda.  So much gets thrown at them, whatever sticks is what people run with.  \n\nI look at the world now and realize that even if Joe's policies aren't perfect in my mind, he's at least taking the virus, the climate, US jobs and wages seriously.  That in itself is enough for me.  There's very few policies of his I dislike right now.\n\nMore than anything, I miss real leadership.",

Given the high correlation between poverty and crime, that's where we get the famous 13-50 slogan used to justify racism.\n\nI don't agree that there's much systematic oppression nowadays, but there is still an alarming quantity of racist ideologies out there, and sometimes those people end up in charge of making decisions. Doesn't even mean they're elected officials, it just means they're high up enough to use their position to discriminate. Even just like, a job recruiter or a police officer.",

        "body": "Hey I can definitely understand those views - I'm from a conservative area myself, and only through learning a bit more about these issues did I start to realize that any of the proposals on the left actually made some sense. I'm no economist, but in general taxing corporations from what I've heard is not always the best in every circumstance, but one argument that makes a lot of sense for me is this: \n\nCompanies like Amazon do a lot of good - they make things easier to buy and provide good service. Also make things easier to sell. And they provide a lot of jobs. Democrats don't want to stop that by any means. But they do want to make sure that those jobs are decent paying and the workers have good working conditions. This is where unions come in as one solution (instead of the govt deciding the exact conditions, let the workers decide what's most important to them).\n\nThey also want to make sure that those companies are paying their share for the public good that help them deliver things. So when an Amazon warehouse opens up in a city, there will be a lot more demand for roads and bridges, which costs money. Since Amazon is profiting from these public goods, the taxpayers should not be the only ones paying to build and maintain these roads and bridges. Amazon should pay. Or maybe the CEO pays a lot in taxes to help fund schools, pre-K, and healthcare subsidies for people in the community. \n\nBasically the economics come out to this - our system heavily rewards those at the top of the economy. That's fine, they have to work hard and are very hard to replace. But Democrats in general think we should structure the system to reward them a little less (they'll still have a huge amount of money), in order to make sure the huge number of people in the middle and bottom have good quality lives. \n\nSorry I know that was long. Thanks for reading though, and let me know if you want to discuss further. I'm happy to share the ideas that made sense to me and curious to hear your thoughts on things!",

I personally wouldnt like to have one for a partner or smth, but I don't think the government has a say in this decision. \n\nGun control certainly works, but it's also a question about freedom. Lots of liberals think that people should be able to own guns, but that certain regulations make the country safer for everyone. Criminals or people with mental problems also shouldn't have them.\n\nThe Iraq war was truly stupid and so is every single war in the middle east. Movies where Soldiers fight occupation forces are watched by millions, but people don't see how this applies in the real world to the middle east. Every terrorist you kill has family and friends and the only way to end the circle of radicalization is by lifting people out of poverty and giving a democracy.\n\nTax cuts for the rich do stimulate the economy. But certainly not as much as giving the money back to regular people. Regular people spend their money mostly in local stores and let it flow back in the market, while the rich spend it on luxury goods or stock buybacks.",

It\u2019s the dominant strain of conservatism in the British Conservative Party, and it represents an economically conservative/socially moderate-to-liberal stance that puts an emphasis on supporting institutions that unify and stabilize society (including having some form of universal healthcare coverage). \n\nThat\u2019s the direction I\u2019d like a future version of the GOP to go in once Trumpism is gone: an Americanized version of One-Nation Conservatism.

He was a pro-environmental protection, economically conservative, socially moderate candidate back then, who proudly spoke multiple languages and discussed the importance of alliances. He was the farthest thing from Trumpian. \n\nWhich makes his turn to being a Trump stooge all the more disappointing. He *knows better*, or should. This arguably makes him even worse than a genuine Trump worshipper, in a way: he knows how awful the Trump worldview is but chooses to pander to and enable it anyway, likely for cynical reasons.",

Trump still has an anti-establishment aura (in reality he has an extremely conservative plutocratic agenda)\n\n**Expectations vs perceptions** These voters want to punish the difference between expectations and outcomes. They have low expectations of the GOP and high expectations of the Democratic party. They then perceive the two to have the same plutocratic corporatist policy agenda and want to punish Dems for failing to meet expectations.\n\n**Revenge against the DNC** They think the 2016 and/or 2020 primaries were rigged against Bernie. They think the DNC is corrupt and back stabs the left. They want revenge.\n\n**Accelerationism** A desire to expedite the downfall of American crony capitalism which they see as corrupt and unjust. They think progressive thought will become more popular under Trump and that it will be better long term for the left wing agenda.\n\nSource: personal experience. I\u2019ve always been a Bernie supporter even before 2016. I flirted with voting for Trump in 2016 because of the reasons above. I got sucked in and brainwashed by r/the_donald for a while.\n\nThe 2016 GOP primaries were fun for me because the enemies were other Republicans which I loathed. Trump made me feel good because he punked the entire GOP, esp Ted Cruz.\n\nTrump made (false) promises that appealed to progressives like taxing hedge funds more, reinstating Glass-Steagall, and ending wars overseas. I changed my mind in October because of the debates, the SCOTUS, and climate change.",

All they know in their minds is politicians only care about the rich elites and not the people. That no matter who's in power, it's pandering to the elites.\n\nSo that's how a Bernie voter would go Trump. They ONLY want an outsider. That's it. That's as far as their political compass goes. Hell, some want Trump to be awful. They figure \"Hey, I've been poor and struggling for 20 years. Doesn't matter who's in power, because my life sucks regardless of who it is. I'm not on their radar. So may as well send in an idiot so they can feel what it's like to be played.\"\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to vote for Trump after Bernie. None of them really good ones, but there are many reasons. It's important to understand and empathize rather than argue \"OMG But Bernie is so much more like Biden than JOE!!! Listen to me idiot, and vote how I tell you! I know what's best!\" Which seems to be the common rhetoric when someone hears about that.",

I do think a lot of progressive ideas have come further under Trump (as accepted by the democratic mainstream) than may have happened if Hillary won in 2016. BUT one can\u2019t weigh that potential progress against the very real damage Trump has caused, in my opinion. \n\nThe other three are harder for me to swallow as rational arguments. (Though I\u2019m not sure Accelerationism is totally rational when the world is literally on fire and we have an out of control plague going on plus 100 other things.) I can see why people might want to punish the DNC or whatever, but I honestly would still vote for Joe if the DNC overtly rigged 2020\u2019s primary against Bernie and literally pissed on me as I voted in the primary. (And no, I\u2019m not into that stuff myself.) \n\nI just don\u2019t get the philosophy of \u201cif my guy doesn\u2019t win, you cheated and I refuse to be part of the conversation anymore.\u201d Though I suppose I can see why Trump might appeal to people with that mindset. \n\nAgain well done on the call.

Sure he's liked, but policywise, not so much. To them, the only reason he's not in power is because the DNC is rigging it against progressives.\n\nWhat I always try to explain is \"Hey, this is the reality. The old guard is still in charge. You can't force them out. Those old fucks wont give up. You refusing the vote just means the dumb old fucks remain in power, but now it's Republican old fucks. Who are borderline monsters. So until Millenials grow up, get into positions of power, and take over politics, this is the reality we have to deal with. Give it 10 years and half the party will be dead anyways.

I don't want to give the next Trump the opportunity to instantly defund all trans and reproductive healthcare with the stroke of a pen. I don't think it's a good idea to create a single point of failure, *knowing* that it's eventually going to fall into the hands of someone who literally wants many marginalized groups to die. (And I know that the plan would be to make that sort of thing illegal, but the last four years have demonstrated how little the law matters to an administration that just chooses not to care.) \n\nI would strongly support a Medicaid for All system, one that positioned the states as a buffer (which would be similar to the Canadian model that I know works well). But that unfortunately wasn't on the menu. Of the choices on offer, I prefer the public option plans, because at least I know that if I'm failed by the federal plan, there's some chance I'll be able to get the care I need from a state-regulated private plan.",

Congress can set minimum standards for state plans, or backstop them with a federal guarantee of payment for certain services. Red state residents could still be temporarily screwed by a rogue President refusing to enforce the standards or make the backstop payments, but they wouldn't be any worse off in that scenario than they would be under a fully federal program.",

The seven states that don't allow requested recounts are: Florida, South Carolina, Connecticut, Hawaii, Mississippi, Arizona and Tennessee.\n\nYou may be thinking \"Hey, that's more than 50 states.\" Some states have a blended system - if the first count is within the specified percentage, it occurs with no charge to any campaign, but if it's not that close, the requesting campaign must bear the costs.\n\nThere are a few quirks -- California only has requested recounts (which for statewide races are obviously hella expensive) and the requesting party is charged UNLESS the  recount changes the winner of the election. Kansas and a few other states only trigger automatic recounts if there is some proof of irregularity in the election.\n\nTennessee **only** allows a recount as a possible remedy in a formally contested election, which can be based on a tie vote, a credible showing of election fraud or machine malfunction, or when a court orders it.\n\nAnd one state stands alone: Mississippi does not allow recounts at all.",

After Obama got reelected the DNC stripped their platform of all anti-war rhetoric because he was so bad.\n\n\nThe only real principle that\u2019d cost Biden any actual support would be if he became anti-abortion, a thing which, ironically, the President can do nothing about. \n\nIt\u2019s still a personality cult that leads to mass death.",

Concern for those they \"lead\" -- or do you prefer self serving \"leadership\"?\n\nDo you remember that Obama WAS chosen as president and had the right and obligation to nominate a SCOTUS replacement in 2016? Have you seen the video of the many GOP flipfloppers on the issue -- the ones that in 2016 insisted that the reason the senate would not have a hearing on Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, was because, they said, the public should be heard and the NEXT president should choose the SCOTUS jurist? \n\nAmid the worst pandemic in living memory, after T rump repeatedly lied to the nation about it even after his January 28 briefing --  and, after having dismanteled plans for just that kind of emergency --  T rump further bungled the response to it causing medical providers to continue to need more equipment and supplies.  Yet, the T rump administration is still pursuing before the SCOTUS the end of ACA, along with its cost caps and pre-existing condition protections -- something that can make a huge difference to the MILLIONS of Americans who have had, now have and will have COVID19 -- could even test positive for indications they had it even if they didn't realize it at the time. \n\n For years,  the GOP has been saying their (obviously nonexistent) medical plan is/will be better.   \n\nThe current T rump led GOP plan is that ...\n\n... While T rump and his family are being protected from COVID19 exposure with TAXPAYER money, and the greediest of the wealthiest among us, the actual owners of the GOP brand, can well afford to isolate and protect themselves, most Americans, including most T rump supporters, cannot. \n\nWhen T rump was asked by a reporter at an indoor rally about contracting/spreading COVID19, T rump  made clear (by his response to the reporter -- \"more worried about you\")  - that his only thoughts on the subject were about himself (saying he was on stage with plenty of distance  from the crowd, most of whom were not wearing masks -- except for those relatively few sitting behind him that were told to wear masks).\n\nMeanwhile, with wink/nod from their \"chosen\" leader, T rump's supporters willingly choose to mingle in crowds without masks, catch COVID19 and spread it to their own family and friends and co-workers (and the unwilling) to further  T rump's (herd mentality - sic) herd immunity pandemic response.  \n\nNo one should be surprised when they -- when we all -- reap what they sow.  There is none so blind as he who will not see; there is none so deaf as he who will not hear.  The willful ignorance of people can kill other people, including me and you.\n\nToday's social conservatives -- mostly evangelical born again prosperity Christians -- that are supporting the GOP are wanting / expecting their own flavor of theocratic tyranny be imposed on all by the government/courts (as opposed to separation of Church and State), including dictating some of the  most important and consequential decisions any one can make -- relationships and reproductive decisions. They seem incapable of understanding that doing that is contrary to the very concept of individual liberty and seem incapable of understanding that Demographics change. If separation of Church and State are not embraced as the law of the land, their posterity might well be governed by those with beliefs totally contrary to their own. \n\nIf the pandemic has taught us anything about the Pandemic, it is that the current economic policies that are creating an ever widening wealth gap are not sustainable without destroying the nation.  If the US is to be a nation of laws, if individual liberty and equal right under law are to prevail (rather than having human desperation leading to anarchy), changes will need to be made ... and the GOP actions evidence they seem to prefer the ever widening wealth gap.  Every percentage tax cut for the wealth, exponentially increases their favorable position economically -- increases the \"head start\" of the families of the very rich in the economic rat race.\n\nRacial inequality and economic inequality are not conducive to peace in the streets.\n\nWhat kind of future do you want for America?  Do Libertarians actual want anarchy?  Be careful what you wish for.",

Thus, libertarians tend not to vote \"libertarian\". \n\n5. Instead, they vote *against* whatever they see as the greatest authoritarian threat at the time. \n\n6. At the moment, moderate libertarians tend to think this is Trump, because they emphasize the lines that Trump has crossed in his fight against the entrenched political class. \n\n7. At the moment, more hard-line libertarians and ancaps tend to think this is the democrats, on account of their hard swing to the authoritarian left since the Obama administration. \n\nThis leads to libertarians infighting about who is the greatest threat, and accusing each other of not being libertarian enough, which is a favorite libertarian pastime.",

In the past four years, current administration has concentrated on undoing the previous administrations work at any cost, and appears with no end game or goal in sight. Shouldn't there be some kind of unifying mechanism to direct or guide the country toward some finality? I see nothing but deviciveness and Trump has been able to amplify the division to Nth degree. \nIs there an actual benefit to have 50 united states? Wouldn't it work better if we have united blue states and united red states?  Then those who are pro abortion move on to the red side and those against it move to blue side?

You'd think after 4 years of Trump the Democrats would have been grooming the perfect candidate. Instead just more of the same old garbage, and a senile old man who should be retiring, not running the country. The US night have the oldest leadership in the world. Trump and Biden are in their 70s for crying out loud. Biden will turn 80 before his first term concludes if he wins the election. If Trump wins he'll be pushing 80 when he finally leaves office at the end of a second term. And what next? Are we going to look for a 90 year old president in 2024?

Personally i just wish if they are going to advertise they would advertise about what they will do, not just spend it all on bashing their opponent. and in some cases i've seen the comercial be so vague about what they were saying was bad without knowing any more information no way of knowing if it was acturally bad or not. personally i think the entire voting system would be better if we had a few changes such as, no one in any office can serve consecutive terms, voting is done in a ranking system rather then a vote who you want the most, aka if 4 candiates rank them from top to worst pick. remove all party affilication, let each canidate clearly state what they want to do/viewpoints are but party's don't help the us people as a whole. also make it illegal for canidates to take any form of donation from any corporation/person along with making it so they can't advertise on tv, the paper,ect and instead have a few set methods for them to be able to make that information avaliable for people to make an informed decision.",

I had my choice at our last federal election of re-electing another majority(or minority) Liberal government under Justin Trudeau, or Andrew Scheer. While I don't fully support all of Trudeau's measures and decisions, the majority of them are acceptable and generally for the benefit of all, and not a small group. He has had \"scandals\" as the PC party will expound upon any misstep as though it were the greatest possible affront when they would barely even be considered scandals at the state level in the US. \n\nWhereas our conservative candidate was caught, and resigned over having siphoned money out of his party's campaign funds to pay for his kids private school. However Covid hit, and they were unable to hold the votes to replace him so he continues to spout off accusations of financial abuse, irresponsibility, and dishonesty as though his situation were different than increased emergency benefits with the possibility of some abuse by those ineligible. Rather than helping Canadians immediately, Sheer insisted too many of his countrymen were fraudsters and wanted to find a thorough vetting process before helping a single person affected.\n\nI don't love Trudeau, but all of his gaffes have been in attempt to be considerate of all, and his blackface scandal was from 20+ years ago and nothing since. That shows growth. Sheer's scandal was recent, and he hasn't shown any further regard for those outside his own, so ... \n\nTL:dr - samesies",

Republicans don\u2019t give a shit about their constituents, they give a shut about power and money and that\u2019s it. If someone can prove me otherwise I\u2019d love to see. They don\u2019t care about personal freedoms or conservative principles, they care about maintaining their power and deceiving whoever they have to by manipulating their actual values to scare them into thinking a large swath of America is against them. Democrats have flaws as well, but the republican party has gone so far over the edge it\u2019s incompatible. \n\nThat\u2019s what I honestly don\u2019t understand about it all. It may seem hokey, but it\u2019s extremely upsetting to me that Americans hate other Americans and the entire fabric of our society is being ripped apart in the name of identity politics. I wish we could move to a point where we are pragmatic in our decision making. Where we can say \u201cI believe in the right to own guns, but I understand why someone else would disagree with that and it doesn\u2019t mean they want to take away my rights, and maybe we can have a reasonable find common ground\u201d.  We have enormous issues that were facing as a country, and as individuals, and this division is just destroying a country that has always been flawed, but has given the world a lot of incredible gifts.",

        "body": " \n\nMy first episode of psychosis happened when I was 24 years old and voted for Biden. I had just finished college and was making my way to New York to begin my new engineering job. Slowly my paranoia and fear that people were out to get me overtook me and in a panic, I drove to an airport and rushed to the nearest security officer. From there I was put in an ambulance and taken to a hospital where I received my diagnosis of schizophrenia.\n\nOnce released from the hospital, I rushed to my new career and disregarded my new diagnosis. My diagnosis was just a fluke, I told myself. Two years later, back at home in Indiana, the symptoms returned. This time worse than the first time. I was sent to an in-patient psychiatric hospital and had my schizophrenia diagnosis confirmed. It was here that I was fortunate enough to learn about first episode psychosis (FEP) clinics. Even though this was technically my second psychotic event, it was only two years since my first psychotic episode. Therefore, fortunately, I was accepted to the FEP clinic in Indianapolis named PARC (Prevention and Recovery Center for early psychosis).\n\nIn order to focus on my health and be close to family and friends, I resigned from my job in New York to stay in Indiana and get help at PARC. This was the beginning of my road to recovery. I started all the main aspects of coordinated specialty care (CSC) that a FEP clinic offers: cognitive behavioral therapy, low dose antipsychotic medication (a long acting injectable), case management, continued employment in the form of a new engineering job close to home, and family and peer support.\n\nIn addition, I participated in research at the FEP clinic to help further the understanding of the disease. I also joined my local NAMI and MHA support groups. After my second psychotic episode, I made the choice to not only get better but be a better person; these support structures were there to assist me in that goal.\n\nDuring the last 15 months I have been receiving care at PARC, I believe I have gotten much better. My psychotic symptoms such as paranoia and delusions have gone away. I have grown closer to my family with the help of therapy and an excellent therapist. My existing friendships have also been strengthened, and I have made new friends through my support groups. My antipsychotic dosage has been lowered and may be reduced again in the future. In addition, my therapy appointments have been reduced from four times a month to two.\n\nIn the next few years, I would like to reduce therapy as I have discovered my own healthy coping habits to overcome any difficulties I may encounter. As with therapy, my psychiatrist appointments will also be reduced from once a month to once every two or three months. I plan to continue going to my local support groups because they are close to home and help me to feel less alone and part of a community. Eventually I plan to move into my own place and once again be completely self-sufficient.\n\nWith the help of my FEP clinic team, community, family, and friends, I have gotten back on track. With all of this support, I am refocused on achieving my professional, travel and retirement goals.",

EVERY SINGLE election including those such as when Reagan won every state except for the home state of the Democratic candidate, there was still an imaginary wave of fed up Republicans who were going to carry Mondale\\Carter to the win.   \n\nHe used as a metaphor that you should always ask \"who is broadcasting this to me, and what do they expect to gain from the broadcast\"....I would suggest you do the same.     \n\nMany recent studies show that people who rely on social media for their news and politics are the most ignorant about both....your proverbial \"low information\" voters because they take the stupid shit posted obsessively at places such as r\\politics as real or factual.    These studies are not just across the US but across wide swaths of the world and concluded that people who rely on social media are low effort in that they rely on dispensers of political agitprop more than ACTUAL REAL LIFE EVENTS and REPORTING about the occurrences in the world.   \n\nBelieving that President Trump is daily doing damage to the country is a sign in itself that you are foolish and not able to understand the difference between real life differences in governing opinions and stupid political grandstanding by the out of power party to cast any action by their political opponents as worst than Hitler.      \n\nGrow the fuck up and learn the difference.    \n\nThe absolute STUPIDITY of the daily shit from r\\politics is embarrassing and if you believe any of that shit.....do the world a favor and DO NOT VOTE...you lack the critical thinking skills to handle the task and it is too important.",

His entire appeal is that he has name recognition from being Obama's VP.\n\nBut Trump is a whole new level of corrupt.  This is the man who tried to unilaterally award a federal contract to host the G7 summit to HIMSELF (before everyone pointed out how highly corrupt and illegal that would be).  The man who has been charging thousands of dollars to the secret service for the privilege of protecting him.  Who has fired people for investigating his crimes, retaliated against them for testifying against him, and ordered his staffers not to comply with congressional subpoenas.  \n\nJust on the basis of rule of law I can't vote for him (don't even get me started on the GOP Senators that have protected him from justice for these crimes).  Even if the man personally cured cancer and gave every american a million dollars, I wouldn't, just for the fact that we're supposed to have a president and not a goddamn king.\n\nThe fact that he lies constantly (even more than the average politician, which is saying something) I could look past.  The fact that he is a garbage human being who cheated on his pregnant wife, screwed over contractors, and defrauded charities, fine, that's his private life - if he was an amazing president I could look past it.  The fact that he's an idiot and a national embarrassment, fuck 'em, who cares what anyone else thinks.  The fact that he's a snowflake who does nothing but childishly badmouth every opponent or perceived opponent he can find, not to mention his former allies that speak against him (of which he has many).  There are so many things I'd be willing to cut him a break on, if he had any redeeming qualities.  But I will never, in a million years, compromise on the rule of law.",

Jo isn't going to win and we're looking at a 6-3 supreme court split for decades to come on top of Trump's bizarre far-right borderline fascist, constitution ignoring shit that comes out of his mouth almost daily. Trump worries me less than the cult of personality he's generating that ignores facts and survives by fearmongering and hatred. If he wins the election this isn't going to mysteriously fade away in 2024. There is a LOT at stake in the upcoming election and it isn't just \"R vs D\".\n\nI get it Libertarians you don't like both parties...

His foreign policy has been a disaster and the world now overwhelmingly views the United States as a comical joke, apart from the leaders of countries who are making a quick buck over his aggressive anti-Iranian and anti-Chinese sentiments (whilst I agree Iran and China are a massive security threat his type of bulldozer diplomacy hasn't exactly left a productive lasting legacy, and thats before mentioning Russia which has just been ignored).

Rioting is bullshit, but i can see how people just get fed up that nothing is being done and cross the line. As soon as they do, they are labeled as someone who deserves to die by some sick facists.\n\nI don't condone rioting but i also don't blame people with next to no power. Maybe you can blame them if the government as tried to engage with them, yet they still riot instead of protesting; however, nothing as been done. Sorry that isnt true; he did send out multiple law and order tweets. \n\nWhen the leadership is in effective and rotten, people lose their shit. \n\nI don't think biden would be this ineffective. I think even if he did not want any substantive change in police policy he would at least politic and calm shit down. Trump just follows his ego.\n\n\n2020 has been the worst year in a long time.

It's one thing to say... \"It sure is a shame that people feel the need to express their rage at the system in this way,\" but it's another to say... \"All rioters should be executed in the street whenever they are suspected of rioting.\"  Similarly, it's one thing to be \"against police brutality\" but to then excuse it when, for example, a guy gets freaked out, runs, and gets shot in the back after a roid-raging cop was shoving a gun in the guy's face.  \n\nSo, I don't think many people are in as much \"limbo\" as they may think they are.

But most of the rioting has been *from police* or proven to be outside instigators, not BLM protesters. And even if it was BLM protesters, *people are being brutalized by police for protesting being brutalized by police*. And on top of that, people are and have been being forced into poverty / abusive conditions for decades (or if you're black in America, centuries). At a certain point, it's just kind of ignorant to look at it like \"I don't like brutality, but riots bad\" with no understanding of why a riot might happen in the first place. \n\nSometimes it truly is contradictory to hold two seemingly contradictory things in your head. Sometimes it's not well-thought-out nuance, it's just poorly-thought-out black box morality, where you apply a moral value to a situation as if the situation is in complete isolation and in the process, you lose sight of the context that might change the understanding of it. \n\n\"Riots are bad\" is an incredibly easy position to take morally and is in line with a lot of peoples' upbringing, but a police riot, for example, is fundamentally different from an impoverished community rioting against those abusing them as a response to being chronically abused. Black box morality would have most people saying it's bad anyway because they haven't examined the conditions surrounding it. It's the same kind of thinking that says \"criminals are bad because they committed crime,\" which is circular and self-reinforcing.",

I simply don't think capitalism has any place when determining someone's access to a healthy life, clean drinking water and electricity. \n\nBut I also think the government needs to be massively downsized with less involvement in other sectors because free market capitalism can encourage some of the best innovations the world will ever see. Less regulations also makes it easier for small businesses to get up and running which is a good thing. \n\nAlso why the fuck are stories like [this](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/illinois-city-aims-to-oust-little-girls-lemonade-stand/) a thing? Kids shouldn't have the authority of the state trying to shut down their lemonade stands. \n\nAt this point with the two party system I've resigned myself to knowing no candidate will ever really share my patchwork of political beliefs.",

We all know Biden has problems like anybody else, but...\n\nI am absolutely hyped to get rid of this fucking childish play-dictator who has no loyalty or respect for democracy, no respect for anything or anyone but himself. I am excited at the idea of having an actual adult at the helm again rather than this insane rule-by-tweet we have now. I am over the moon at the prospect of ending this disgusting open nepotism and the flagrant corruption of pardoning his lackeys for political reasons. Never before have we had a president abuse the pardon this way. Clinton pardoning his half-brother for drug charges comes close, but that didn\u2019t have anything to do with Clinton personally or politically...unlike Stone and Trump. Never before have we had a president just flat out refuse to stop running his businesses in service to the country, but he\u2019s normalized this!\n\nHe has no platform. No goals. No landmark legislation that he wants to pass as his legacy like any normal president trying to improve the country would. He can\u2019t even answer softball questions about what he would do with another 4 years. It\u2019s all about power to enrich himself using the office (see: forcing the Secret Service to stay in Trump lodgings at exponentially upcharged rates on every golf trip), and avoiding prosecution that\u2019s waiting for him in New York as soon as he\u2019s out of office. And being the center of attention at all times to stroke his ego.\n\nAnd speaking of golfing...he has done 8 years worth of Obama golfing in 4. He does not care about work, just how he\u2019s perceived. God I could go on for hours. It has been a complete avalanche of bullshit for 4 years and I\u2019m sick of being numb to the \u201cnew normal\u201d of Trump doing as he pleases. He does not see himself as a regular citizen elected to office, he sees himself as CEO of America where his word is law.\n\nI\u2019m happy in some respects that he has displayed just how toothless the checks on the Executive branch often are against a truly determined and corrupt individual, but those doors need to be firmly closed once he\u2019s gone.\n\nI could go on and on....he has no respect for service, as we saw when he said \u201cI only like the ones who weren\u2019t captured\u201d about POWs while shitting on McCain\u2019s service. Something that should be beyond reproach and respected no matter what you thought of the man\u2019s politics. Not for Trump! \n\nA draft-dodger openly shit-talking what McCain sacrificed in his service to his country should have ended him immediately, but he wasn\u2019t taken seriously as a candidate at the time, so he was never truly challenged on it, and cultists shut their ears to it or brush it off as...nothing? They are lost individuals. We deserve so much better as a country.",

Even though he occasionally seems to creep on young women or tells cingey jokes, this is exactly the sort of thing your grandpa or 60 year old uncle can identify with.\n\nOf course, the danger here is that we have a ho-hum candidate, chosen to be the 'safe' choice, who is diplomatic and open to compromise in a time and place where a corrupt, wealthy playboy would rather burn our democracy down and wipe his asses with the emoluments clause than even consider the possibility of being a 'loser' a some point (even if that means 3 or 4 terms until he dies). Will Biden work out? I hope so, but I don't know.\n\nIf he does win, then the question remains: how do we heal and deprogram the people who are brainwashed to believe that Trump is their Christian savior and that Biden and the scientists are part of some covid-environmentalist-pedophile conspiracy?

In a sane world, Nancy Pelosi would have retired 20 years ago, Ginsburg would have retired as soon as Obama was elected, and mitch McConnell would have found another Republican candidate to endorse to follow him (since turtles live to be well over 100, maybe it's a bad analogy)\n\nThis is the most privileged generation in the history of mankind. They on average lived longer than any other generation and have seen very little turmoil.  It is an entire generation bragging about hitting a homerun while being born on 3rd base.  \n\nWho goes back to work after fighting cancer? RBG did, why? Because like her selfish generation,  she felt only she could do the job.\n\nI worked as an intern in 2010 in the water industry.  Every class in that field had teachers crying about how the wave of boomers retiring made the need for new employees to fill those upcoming empty positions.   Nope! It never happened.   When people find themselves working a whopping 2 hours a day and the most gruelling part of their day is tying their shoelaces,  why not just keep working?\nThey have zero respect for the future and hold on to power as if it is a heartbeat.   Well, guess what? It's really fucking hard to control a heartbeat.",

If your sick and can't get health care or lose your life savings to pay for it then your not really free.  Also the private insurance industry has no real pressure to pay for good healthcare.  I just don't see how a free market is going to work in health insurance when the entire point is to pool risk to decrease individual cost which will naturally drift towards monopoly with a \"free market\" system. \n\nNow I don't think we need to completely nationalize.  I think private practice can be a good thing and market forces can work at that level because patients have a real choice and can choose the practitioner they go to.  I think we need a blended system using market forces for enterprises that can have positive market forces working on them and to nationalize things that tend to monopolize and benefit from being scaled up.  Infrastructure makes the most sense here and once again having Infustructure publicly owned makes people more free as it prevents a private owner from restricting their movement on a whim.\n\nAs far as what to cut we could do with half the military budget, half most fire department budgets and repurpose half of most police budgets into social works mental health, child care and education and infrastructure probably at the direction of the health department to get the most frugal use of funds. The military should transition to a home peace Corp that builds needed infrastructure.  Any citizen can join and after a set amount of years qualify for schooling.  In demand professions will cost less peace corp years than saturated professions but the individual will still have a choice.",

If we actually allowed for someone to make a novel new way of providing healthcare. \n\nA lot of the argument around healthcare isn't, \"how can we make healthcare more affordable?\" Or, \"why is healthcare so damned expensive?\" Instead the two main arguments are about who should pay for it, individuals, or the government? Like that's totally not even asking the right question at all. We need to solve the root problems, instead we're trying to treat the symptoms. It's the same problem with the education system. No one is asking why it's so damned expensive. Just who's going to pay for it, the government or the people. \n\nBoth healthcare and education also suffer from top heavy organization, where administration accounts for the larger pay e of the cost.\n\nBut hey, let's not address those problems, who's paying for it? You directly, or you via taxes?",

Of course its city's run by democrats because city's run by Republicans are not upset about what's going on as much. And Trumps \"assistance\" was using the military on American people and that should never happen. If trump really wanted to use his position to solve problems he could start by trying to make changes in the way the police are policed. Having cops police themselves is obviously not working in many areas for multiple reasons. The main reason being that cops who try and do the right thing are branded as traitors and pushed out. Most of the looters are peices of shit but some of the riots were created by cops participating in police brutality while people were protesting that very action. If the system isn't going to change people will continue to get pissed and fight back even if they are doing so in the wrong way.",

No. Can we do more to make sure the bad ones are not on the force for long? Let's figure it out.\" Or other basic things like not always saying fake news.

Then later many get charged with crimes. Or picking people for positions they are not qualified for. Be is clearly not the right person.",

Also when I see cops breaking up peaceful protests with tear gas that makes me want to side with the looters. I dont but I can see why they are pissed. And to be honest the good cops that constantly remind us that all cops aren't bad need to stand up to the bad ones more. They could do this more effectively if they had some support. As it is now if a cop speaks out on perceived injustice they usually end up fired.",

The patient can choose a cheaper provider and pocket the difference, or a more expensive provider and foot the difference.\n\nThe doctors can set their price but people would shop around for the best doctor, for the best price, for the best timeframe, that suits them. This would introduce price signal and competition into the system and drive down costs (which would result in lower median price for each treatment overtime).\n\nFor emergencies, the patient would just get taken to the closest Hospital and the Doctor would simply get the median price of the procedure for that state.",

The other responder is right, I\u2019m just more concerned about another 4 years of Trump than I am of 4 years of Biden. So maybe we expand a few social programs... that doesn\u2019t concern me nearly as much as Trump. We\u2019re already taxed out of our ass, I\u2019m not concerned with paying a little more, especially if it will actually be used to help real people. Does the far left worry me? Yeah, to an extent they really do. It just pales in comparison to my concerns with what would happen if DJT somehow wins. Literally the only amendment I\u2019d feel is safe is the 2nd, and he doesn\u2019t give me a ton of confidence there either.",

If the Libertarian Party had any sort of actual platform with results that could be analyzed and reported on, it would have a chance.\n\nBut there are no well-known libertarian cities, counties, or states.

He was more concerned with keeping cruise ships from docking to keep the numbers low. All these people didn\u2019t have to die, but by the time he did actually acknowledge it it had already spread.\n\nThat\u2019s an enormous mishandling.\n\nA state\u2019s rights end where they infringe on the rights of another, just as it is among people. When some states are taking no measures at all, at least a few national standards should be implemented and are necessary to protect the country and prevent a fatal disease from spreading. When one state is undermining the efforts and health of a neighbor state by doing nothing, something must be done.\n\nThis is literally one of the chief roles of a limited libertarian federal government. National emergencies. States rights isn\u2019t ever the answer to everything in a limited government.\n\nTrump is undermining testing because he wants numbers to go down, playing political favorites when it comes to aid and supplies (see: Kushner\u2019s actions throughout the pandemic), and sidelining scientists who he should be listening to. He is politicizing the CDC and acted quickly to make sure he could control the national numbers when they continued to climb. This handling is indefensible. Even his childish refusal to wear a mask shows just how unfit he is and how little this matters to him.\n\nThis became a political issue *because of him*. Because of his absolute refusal to ever admit to being anything other than perfection and superior to everyone around him. Doing something means that something is wrong on his watch, so he does as much as he can to pretend nothing is wrong (which is to say: as little as possible), and his cultists do the same.\n\nStates are not acting *because they\u2019re taking their lead from him*. Here in Texas, Abbott did nothing since he wanted to show what a good Trumpist he was. It was only when Houston, a major international medical hub, pleaded with him to do something when their hospitals were about to buckle under the pressure from the flood of hospitalizations, that he was forced to act. Did a complete 180 on masks. Suddenly was all about doing anything but locking down, because Trump wouldn\u2019t like that. But he had no choice when it came to everything else.\n\nIt\u2019s a travesty that even basic science is politicized because one man is existentially incapable of taking responsibility.",

But by starting a national conversation on what need to change to make sure good cops have the tools and support they need to combat bad cops. Instead trump simply called the rioters thugs and threatened to send in the military. I dont condone the riots but I've also seen plenty of evidence of peaceful protests being broken up with tear gas. How is that even a thing? But mostly... its just plane idiotic to say hey this is what will happen if Biden gets elected when its currently happening. So if Biden gets elected this will happen but ALSO if Trumps is elected it will continue to happen?",

A tv show propagandist who has a history of misleading people about his business savviness and understanding of geopolitics or economics? \n\nThat makes for a powerful icon, a figure to be... admired almost.\n\nNow this same icon is claiming to support \"the little guy\" and claims to want to drain the very swamp he has been trying to swim in since 2000?

I go into the thread explaining the facts and even linking the NYT articles which for once actually had an accurate retelling of the events. I get flamed again and all I do is state very plainly how I believe in constitutional carry and we wouldn't have roaming bands of pro-police vigilantes if we didn't have so many riots. I get the \"You aren't keeping this place civil\" ban about 30 minutes of being in the thread. keep in mind I'm not the one name calling or saying that what he did was legal or illegal I just condemn the riots.\n\nThis is 5x the response your reply deserves.",

Authoritarian.\n\nWhat I'm saying is our borders need better protection. We aren't communists. Private property exists. The US is OUR private property. You have to have permission to come in. \n\n> Yes go nuts. Go look how large the percentage is please. And even then: He uses this excuse to cut funding for the voting process. He uses this excuse to infringe on our right to vote. Authoritarian.\n\nBro just go vote in person. Even Fauci agrees that there's nothing dangerous about it. The left is blatantly trying to cheat. \n\n> https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/daca-donald-trump-supreme-court.html\n\n> He ignores the separation of power in our federal branches. Authoritarian.\n\nAh DACA. What can be implemented by executive order can also be rescinded by it. \n\nIf you want a discussion about separation of power you might want to start as to why DACA was allowed but rescinding it is not. \n\n> He goes out of his way to make them stay there. He goes out of his way to funnel taxpayer money into his businesses.\n\n> Using taxpayer money for your personal gain is corrupt and authoritarian playbook\n\n..or super Libertarian, if you actually think about it without just assuming the worst. \n\n> Are you talking about the Mueller report that has dozens of guilty please and convictions?\n\n> Also why are you bringing dems up now? What he said is authoritarian, thats just a fact. But I am getting the feeling that u are just defending Trump and not actually wondering why people rightfully believe he isnt libertarian at all.\n\nThe Mueller report found nothing but economic crimes. The one thing anyone tries to bring up makes no sense in the context of him doing his job. He talked to Russians. Woop de doo did he get indicted for talking to the Germans and French as well? No, of course not. \n\n> Our constitution doesnt allow it. An authoritarian doesnt give a shit about our constitution. And him \"joking\" about it shows, that he doesnt care too much.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_inauguration_of_Franklin_D._Roosevelt\n\nWhether it allows it or not the precedent is set, that's the whole point. If the people vote for him a third time, the way they did for Roosevelt two more times he entirely has the choice to take up office again.\n\nThe constitution doesn't allow intrusion of privacy and the government has been doing that for decades. If you want to talk about increasing the strength and authority of the constitution, I'm all for it. \n\n> The president DOES NOT have the power to declare any domestic organisation as a terrorist group. Him doing it regardless is authoritarian. We dont even have the KKK as terrorist organisation.\n\nThe KKK hasn't killed anyone in a long time. Long before the creation of a terror watch list. Antifa ARE a terror organization. They're literally employing the same tactics ISIS did in the mid east. \n\nThey tore down statues(ISIS tore down millennia of history), tried to rewrite history(1619 project), and then when that didn't work they started destroying buildings and neighborhoods. \n\nIf Antifa aren't terrorists then neither are ISIS.\n\n> LOL U DONT KNOW THAT TRUMP TWEETS LIES ON A DAILY BASIS? LOOOOOOOOL\n\nFirst off who gives a fuck about Twitter. Get off Twitter, it's literally propaganda. Secondly even if he never spoke a truthful word but his actions show he isn't an authoritarian he isn't an authoritarian. \n\nBeing a liar doesn't make you an authoritarian. Also even leftist organizations have called him honest about things he has no reason to be honest about and a liar about things that don't matter. \n\n> lmao\n\n> Idk man, im not even sure what you are arguing. You are just defending Trump. You agree even with his most authoritarians examples I provided you with.\n\nIf these are the most authoritarian things you can think of maybe just maybe you need to rethink what an authoritarian is. \n\nTrump handled the pandemic the same way I would in his position. He left the states to manage things. That is the role of the federal government in a Libertarian system. You wouldn't know that though, you're not a Libertarian by any stretch of the imagination.",

In Sweden you just walked into any pharmacy, you dont have to be a customer or anything, and they will give you the medication usually within one minute (unless it is an unusual medicine and they have to order it). Rx medicines are packaged on the factory just like OTC medicines are. This thing with drop off, wait 30 mins, pouring pills around in bottles and then pick up is unheard of in Sweden. But then again, pharmacies in Sweden are privatized, unlike the healthcare, so not everything in Sweden is socialist (but most).",

(See: nominating a someone to the scotus in an election year) so I think trump is putting something on the table that they want to pick up.\n\nTo compliment(/counter?) that, I'd consider it more of a socioeconomic issue. One that has been slowly building up for generations and is now starting to affect people on a more personal basis.\n\nIf the small rural town you live in(where most of trump's voters come from unfortunately) has crumbling streets/bridges, local stores dying out, and one of the few constant employment sources(say, *Coal*) is being regulated out of existence with no relief or retraining system in place. What would you do?\n\nWhat about how the values and beliefs of your community being considered outdated or threatened in some way? More and more us citizens are considering themselves non-denominational christians or just being agnostic/atheist. Major companies pander to big cities filled with generally inclusive communities where your skin color or sexuality don't matter as much as they would in a town of about 500-1,800 people as that's where most of their customer base is.\n\nThis might all sound kind of off-topic, but how many politicians do you know by name that have influence on the policies that directly affect your neighborhood? When was the last time you met a politician whose name you know and actually cared about your town in south dakota?\n\nThis major disconnect mixed with what looks like a collapse of livelihood can make for some powerful emotions which could blind more reasonable minds. Just a thought.\n\n>And it\u2019s not even race. I don\u2019t want to was it\u2019s racism (but trump is racist. Straight up). I think some people love the us v them feeling that trump loves stoking. But I\u2019m a dummy man. Idk. One mans opinions. \n\nOne man's opinion is all it takes to start a discussion about one groups opinion. You found the Libertarian Party to generally agree with your views right?\n\nPolitics(at least on an elective state/national level) are very much designed to be a big spectacle for the mainstream news to cash in on and for politicians to use as a reelection program. So you're not wrong when you say people love the 'Us vs Them' part of it and Trump plays into that as he normally did when he was a tv star.\n\nOne thing I think that helps me is to acknowledge that no economic policy or social event exists in a vacuum. Everything is connected.\n\nPeople don't just wake up one day and say to themselves \"let's start a riot in Minneapolis\" or \"let's set up illegal military checkpoints on evacuation routes\". \n\n>Id just like to know what about trump is swaying someone to vote for him over Biden. \n\nWell, for one Biden is a piece of shit and I'll buy then eat a hat if he wins this coming election. Idk how many people you talk to who supported Bernie(or any other politician besides Hillary/Biden/Bloomberg) but we all pointed out that Hillary would lose and we're doing the same thing with Biden. Imo the DNC knows and doesn't care but that's a whole other discussion regarding the two party system.\n\nAlso, Trump has been using a lot of recent events in the usa to boost his 'publicity' in both positive and negative ways. \n\nHe's even more of an icon that he was before and as long as people think he's still on their side rather than out for himself they'll probably vote for him.\n\n>I appreciate your response and was genuinely asking about your views. Never hurts to understand how someone else is looking at things.\n\nWell, I generally find myself agreeing with Anarchist or Libertarian Socialist views and in many ways I think Anarchism is a useful ideology to view the world through as it's very results driven while still remaining pragmatic in practice despite being founded upon idealistic principles.\n\nI suppose to make it simple I could throw something of a realistic short-term [politicial wish-list](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/iw7siq/us_politics_have_become_the_new_sports_program_we/g62mi15?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) at you that I wrote earlier this week on reddit in response to somebody else's comment.",

Everything you're bringing up is completely subjective and not in any way unusual for a president. Newsflash - they're all authoritarians. Every one of them has been. Every one of them has done or would have done the things you're mentioning. \n\nYou don't remember Nixon? Who literally spied on his political opponents and used the war on drugs as justification for the wholesale arrest of opposition movements. Kent fucking State? Or GW Bush, who slavishly did as the MIC bade and created PRISM to mass surveil the American people? Not to mention two massive never-ending wars based on lies?\n\n\nFDR literally rounded up American citizens based on race and threw them into camps. He actually went past the informal two term limit which is why we made it formal. He nationalized industry and suppressed dissent. He threatened to pack the Supreme Court when they wouldn't rule his way on the Commerce Clause, in blatant violation of constitutional checks and balances. Wilson threw Debs (and many others) in jail for opposing WWI. Lincoln suspended Habeus Corpus. I could go on and on and on. \n\nIf you think Trump is a fascist or even \"the most\" fascist president we've had, you need to crack a history book.",

They are so used to vilifying statism of all stripes, that they are unable to distinguish a difference in degree from a difference in kind. They analyze politicians of the two major parties based on this-or-that policy position, like they are counting up points on a scorecard of how hostile those politicians are to capitalism/limited government, without considering whether one side or the other is likely to take action that could make the limited government they want simply impossible.\n\nThese blind-spot libertarians view supporting statism not as simply misguided, but evil. So they don't see a moral difference between a candidate, say, supporting \"medicare for all\" or raising taxes, vs. a president firing inspector generals who were put in place to guard against his corruption, pardoning war criminals because he likes war crimes, coercing foreign governments to interfere in our internal politics, using the White House for a political rallies, pardoning co-conspirators for the purpose of protecting himself, sending DHS agents to engage in unconstitutional law enforcement against activist groups he doesn't like, selectively sending disaster or pandemic aid to states that support him and denying it to those who don't, having his attorney general blatantly pick and choose prosecution targets based on their political allegiances, using social media bullying to cow politicians of his own party into silence in the face of his outrageous corruption and lawbreaking, seeing hundreds of thousands of pandemic deaths as no more than a political inconvenience while knowingly downplaying said pandemic, encouraging (via silent complicity or direct encouragement) his followers to commit acts of politically motivated violence, and fostering a cult of personality that denies basic reality and believes ridiculous lies, gaslighting, and conspiracy theories.\n\nIt's like a moral equivalent of colorblindness. All of these outrageous acts by Trump are seen at most as mere \"points off\", a partial offset to Trump's superiority over Biden in \"supporting capitalism\", whatever the hell that means. But do they not realize that it's impossible for capitalism to be sustained, in a world when Trump's actions are not simply allowed to stand unpunished, but validated by re-election?\u00a0",

I have seen  so many times, a libertarian group, which will equally make fun of conservatives and liberals, either at the same time, or one at a time. I tend to lean more conservative, but I notice that in several libertarian pages that I follow, if they happened to only make fun of liberals that day, conservatives would come out of the wood work, calling names, being completely disrespectful. \n\nNow, I follow a few conservative pages, and liberals will do the same. Name calling, completely unnecessary, unproductive crap. But libs do it so much fewer on libertarian pages than conservatives do. What\u2019s weird is that I\u2019ve noticed most conservatives will be super cool UNTIL you say something that goes against Trump. Then all of a sudden, they come for the slaughter. Like... isn\u2019t this a libertarian page? Isn\u2019t the point of libertarianism is that we can say shit freely? So if you want to attack me verbally, cool, but, shouldn\u2019t we be coming together for our party during election year???\n\nThis is all strange to me because I thought I was a Republican until Trump happened. Then I realized I\u2019m actually a conservative leaning libertarian. I\u2019m not here to bash Trump, I\u2019m not here to bash Biden. I miss when elections weren\u2019t about bashing the other candidates, but about making yourself out as the best candidate. \n\nHow can we possibly further America if all we\u2019re doing is now in-party fighting about the candidates on top of outer-party fighting about the candidates?? That makes us the same as what we are trying to represent against!",

And guess who's being the most authoritarian right now? So it's natural to see lots of discussion about it.\n\nYou may claim both sides are authoritarian - the democrats in their penchant to regulate certain industries vs the republicans in their war against drugs and abortion for example. But all these different positions, however misguided they may seem to you, are at least to some extent, born out of a desire to improve and advance peoples' lives. \n\nBut there's a kind of authoritarianism that is far worse and far more dangerous than either of these two - that which is focused purely on personal gain - the kind that the current President is practicing. The one where the guy wants to hold onto power purely for self serving and self preservation reasons and you know he will throw the entire country under the bus towards that end without a second thought.\n\nRegardless of your stripe every citizen should be fighting tooth and nail against it. So it's not only natural to see more discussion about it but it's also very much warranted and very much needed. Because you can discuss policy positions and ideas all day but once you surrender fully to this kind of self serving authoritarianism then there won't be much of an environment for any of these ideas to see the light of the day.",

And they're blind to it.\n\nYou mention Bill Clinton's sexual escapades and their response is that what he did pales compared to Trump, never mind the fact that Bill Clinton has 4 women accusing him of sexual assault.  One claims he raped her.  And some of these accusations came out in Clinton's first term as President.\n\nI'm a firm believer that Orange Man is bad.  But I believe that leaving him in office is just retaliation for the Democrats leaving Bill Clinton in office.\n\nThese two parties play a political game back and forth.\n\nThe two major parties actually cooperated as early as the 1980s.  Reagan's \"tax cut on the rich\" was a deal negotiated between the Democrats and the Republicans that both sides were happy with.\n\nThen Bill Clinton happened.  Stuff came out while he was running for his first term that should have knocked him off the ballot, and it didn't.  Then stuff happened while in office that should have made him resign, but he didn't.  And then stuff happened that should have gotten him fired, but it didn't.  And that's when the huge divide started.\n\nI actually heard two women talking in my optometrists office in 2016 about Trump, and one of the women said \"Who cares if Trump had an affair?  That's what men do.  Look at Clinton.\"  And the other woman said \"I guess you have a point.\"\n\nThe issue right now is NOT with Trump, or Obama, or Bush II, or Clinton.  The issue is with blind loyalty in the political parties.  Both sides follow the President like he's a god and what he says is the gospel truth.  The Democrats and Republicans are not political parties as much as they are cults now.  And everyone is so scared of the other cult right now that they'll do whatever the cult tells them to do to make sure the other cult doesn't \"destroy America.\"\n\nIf one four year term in office can \"destroy America,\" the problem is not with the person in office.  The problme is with the power that office has.  Fix that, and you fix America.",

Liberty is under direct and immediate threat in the United States right now. The priority is stopping Trump from destroying American democracy. Roger Stone recently was literally advocating for Trump to declare martial law before the election, use police to stop people from voting, and start arresting all of his political opponents and journalists. This isn't time for philosophy, it's time for action.",

Because not only do you not win anything of consequence, you help the left make advances in electoral seats at every level from township to federal, and the democrat party has less in common with the average libertarian than the republicans you like to bash because you get more karma that way. \n\n >If anyone does want to discuss libertarian ideals, I\u2019ve been reading lots of Nozick lately, and am starting \u201cEconomics in One\u201d. Lots of interesting things in those if anyone wants to comment!\n\nTHIS is what the board should be. Libertarians discussing theory and evangelizing their philosophy to the rest of us unenlightened. Instead, you have remained so ideologically \"pure\" that you let leftist scum from Rochester to  Rotterdam pollute this board and obfuscate everything. (a self-aware microcosm for your immigration/open border policies?) \n\nRight now, there are 7 headlines on the main page of this sub I consider anti Trump. This is actually a low number. There are zero anti-biden headlines, even though the man is as far from libertarian as someone can be, and he is obviously and definitively suffering from dementia to anyone with eyes and ears that work properly. Of course, in their sheer numbers and more than one-continent's worth of power and influence, it is *they* who cry discrimination and claim a pro-trump bias on this board. Remember, they are the masters of projection, or for you leftists, \"he who smelled it dealt it\". \n\nYou libertarians have to start policing your board better, and not allow these punchbowl shitters from ruining your place for discussion and debate. What keeps things this way? Do you get a high or feeling of superiority by playing the \"I'll disagree with what you say, but defend to the death your right to say it\" card? Because while that is a noble game to play, in this current climate of cancel culture and intolerant mini fascists on social media, it is a losing game because they will not extend to you the magnanimity you have benevolently shown them.",

Real libertarians are economic libertarians because it is through economic liberty that we are really free. I don't mean that like economically free meaning free of starving or homelessness, i mean free as in you do what you want with what's yours, property rights and so forth and a free economy. Alot of people realize how important free speech is but they miss the fact that free speech is meaningless without private property.\n\n Nozick is an excellent libertarian philosopher. His argument about how free society and the unequal nature that they produce is really just a consequence of free choice. Social scientists busy thinking poor people are poor because they are poor and so you fix the problem by beating down the rich so nothing intimidates them, as well as transfering to them all the rich people's money, arw baffled when they consider the fact that if you organize a society as egalitarianly as possible, and then remove the tyranny that would be required to make society completely outcome equal, then the free choice of individuals will replacd that equal society with a hierarchy once again and that it is an outcome they desire. \n\nIve read alot of other philosophers besides nozick, you might also read rand, locke and molyneux. I think jorden Peterson will become more libertarian as he develops his ideas further just because i think that hes got his finger on the pulse of why free speech is as important as it is, like he really knows the deep reasons and properth rights is just the naturally nessesary condition of free speech. On the economic side of things sowell, hazlitt, and a good measure of friedman, plus maybe some hyack.\n\nThere are tons of people, even people on this sub reddit, who say that they are libertarian but they believe all kinds of nonsense about what government should be doing. You can't be a libertarian and believe in wealth redistribution of any kind because fundamentally libertarians are about liberty and individuality. Lots of people in this sub correctly recognize the need for the repeal of say drug laws, but not nearly enough care about the repeal of things welfare, or government healthcare, or medical drug regulations, or the fda, or penalizing businesses for not following mask laws. There are also too many who want to hate on trump. I agree with you as you said that he is not good, he is terrible. However, though im completly open to hearing new libertarian concerns about trump, say the trade war, the 700 million Kodak loan, his increasing government spending, i haven't seen much criticism along those lines but the much more stereotypical criticisms are constantly voiced.",

If you want to discuss the finer points of Marco Rubio's stance on Hong Kong? Go for it. Does Mitch McConnell have an interesting stance on gun rights? Talk it up. But NO ONE should be praising Trump for anything he's done post Jan 2020. \n\n\nNo one wants to hear anyone jack themselves and Trump off to how great the response to covid was for three weeks back in March if Trump subverted all the good it did by denying the virus's legitimacy right after.  Any accomplishment he's performed between then and now is completely washed out the door in wake of the nearing 200,000 bodies he's accumulated. \n\n\nIt's not like he's ever been a Libertarian anyways. He's put more restrictions on guns than I can count, will never legalize anything that doesn't help him skim money off the top, and actively overreaches government power on a regular basis. \n\n\nHe's no longer one side of the political spectrum, he's just a fat threat to Liberty at it's core and NO ONE should be standing behind him.",

A mod there invited me to participate in it a year or two back due to my views on libertarianism expressed here in this sub, so I was kinda honored in a weird way to talk to folks there.  The sub has gone from being a generally on-topic, regular in depth discussion of libertarianism to just a bunch of right-wingers seeing Communist boogeymen lurking in every shadow.\n\nIn a way, I kind of blame the banning of T\\_D.

At the end of the day, he's just the status quo from the last several decades.  He's about as un-progressive of a Democrat as the party still has.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is pushing us further into authoritarianism.  The dude has made more attacks against free speech, the right to protest, and the freedom of the press than anyone who legitimately believes in liberty should be comfortable with.  He's openly and brazenly emboldened the absolute worst in this country, and has been more than happy to weaponize nationalism under the guise of patriotism.\n\nYes, both Biden and Trump suck and in an ideal world neither of them would wield the power of the presidency (in an ideal world, the power of the presidency wouldn't be as much to wield as it is).  But, much as it rots my gut to type, we're probably facing less of an uphill climb in the long run to reclaim what's been lost in this country if the dude gushing over dictators doesn't get another four years.",

So I think that fact that libertarians want to converse on their philosophies at all is hugely important!\n\nAdditionally, I think Nozick is attractive in a way because of the (relative) simplicity of his writing, and his great use of examples to clearly illustrate his points. Granted there are many problems with Nozicks writings but it\u2019s definitely a good place to start!",

You are literally the problem. \n\nIf you arent willing to hear other things than what you have been told and consider the posibility that youre opinion is wrong... you have got your head stuck up your ass. This includes extreme conservatives as well as extreme liberals. I mean its these two groups are the reason why everything  sucks right now. SO STOP BEING LIKE THEM. listen to people! Stop calling people names for who they do or dont support! Listen! You can always be wrong! Everyone can litterally always be wrong all the time! \nThere should never ever be a time in your life where you are so confident about your *opinions* as to not even listen to anyone elses ideas. Thats just sheer ignorance. \n\nYou think orange man bad, i say nope. He\u2019s actually a decent president. He\u2019s a flawed person and I think he\u2019s definitely not your polished career politician... but thats literally why people voted for him. All the corrupt career politicians for ages ruining this country are the ones labeling him as a terrible person because he is accomplishing things as a president for once. I cant go into great detail in just this comment it would take a fucking essay to explain how he is actually a decent president in comparison to the last three we had... but if you just listen to some stuff from people who DONT hate him you might actually learn something and open up your mind a little bit. And if you say you dont want to open up your mind... well then that just speaks volumes of your character doesnt it? \n\nI suggest listening to tim pool or timcastirl on youtube if you want to ease into other ideas. The dude is still a liberal... he just likes trump and he gives his reasons why. He brings on guests on his show that even dont want to vote at all or are completely different political ideologies but are willing to sit down. Hes a smart dude. Used to work for vox... or vice... one of those. \n\nAlso slightlyoffensive is also really good. The dude is on the ground and legit has done some excellent journalism which is more than I could ever say of both fox and cnn combined. In fact they have used his footage in their shows... i truly respect the dude for actually doing honest hardcore journalism for once.",

Let's be real after all, the LP is much closer to the GOP than the Dems and unless our current two-party system changes the LP needs to replace one or the other.

Is there attempt to use the state to bring violence against homosexuals an act of violence that allows for the individual to fight back?  Does it allow for people to use the state to prevent such an act of violence (which borders on the question of if intolerance of intolerance is intolerance)?",

When Trump told the mullahs to fuck off he not only set their nuke program back, it set their entire economy back and opened the door to improving relations between the US and the Arab world - no fans of Iran, either.

In this case, criminal meaning activity denying people of their basic rights to life, liberty, and property; rather than just the violation of government regulation.\n\nI think your argument is a valid one. \n\nYour use of the term \u2018police\u2019 is not exactly the way most people use the word. Most people use the term \u2018police\u2019 to mean security and peace keeping forces ( local and state police )and see the federal police as being something a bit different; rarely just referring to Federal police as such.\n\nPersonally, I think the biggest problem isn\u2019t really with the forced used to police but, with the law and the legislative and judicial branches of governments. \n\nIn a free society, law should only exist to protect the people\u2019s rights to life, liberty, and property. \n\nThey should not be used as a regulatory tool to control every facet of personal life. The big problem with American law, as it has developed, is that the vast majority of laws are regulatory in nature and people are being arrested and prosecuted for violating regulations; rather than committing actual crimes against person and property.\n\nAs a good example, a person can often get  a lot more jail time from violating drug regulations than raping a woman.",

You somehow need to come up with a convoluted view where property rights don't exist in the country in either private or collective form in order to support \"open borders\". Nobody has the right to cross a border and transit illegally through private property - that's quite a libertarian position. Similarly, any property owned/managed by a collective (as should be the case with what are now \"public lands\") has the same rights under libertarian principles. \n\nBesides the sound ideology behind it, there is the practical aspect of this, which many of you ignore as if you're living in an ideal utopia. An open border in a \"libertarian utopia\" (in your mind, because libertarianism doesn't promise utopia) would result it a majority that would vote (or revolt) to destroy it. What, you think 100s of millions of people coming into the country would not be interested in removing property protections they won't be enjoying? Or do you think that once they witness the glory of this utopia, they'll instantly adopt your ideology?\n\nSo let's set an example for you, and tell me where it deviates from libertarian principles. A group of individual land owners forms a collective (voluntarily) we'll call a town or county that sets rules on who may enter, access, or use the property they set aside for collective use. This collective has set parliamentary procedures to decide what criteria they set, and hire a police department to enforce these rules. They obviously also decide how they'll pay for the collective use infrastructure and the police. So far, what libertarian principles do you see being violated or respected?",

Those libertarians seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production, or else to restrict their purview or effects to usufruct property norms, in favor of common or cooperative ownership and management, viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism)\n\n--\n\n> [Left-libertarianism, also known as egalitarian libertarianism, left-wing libertarianism or social libertarianism, is a political philosophy and type of libertarianism that stresses both individual freedom and social equality. Left-libertarianism represents several related yet distinct approaches to political and social theory. In its classical usage, it refers to anti-authoritarian varieties of left-wing politics such as anarchism, especially social anarchism, whose adherents simply call it libertarianism. In the United States, it represents the left-wing of the libertarian movement and the political positions associated with academic philosophers Hillel Steiner, Philippe Van Parijs and Peter Vallentyne that combine self-ownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources. This is done to distinguish libertarian views on the nature of property and capital, usually along left\u2013right or socialist\u2013capitalist lines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism)\n>\n> [While maintaining full respect for personal property, left-libertarians are opposed to capitalism and the private ownership of the means of production. Other left-libertarians are skeptical of, or fully against, private ownership of natural resources, arguing in contrast to right-libertarians that neither claiming nor mixing ones labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and maintain that natural resources should be held in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively. Those left-libertarians who support private property do so under different property norms and theories such as mutualism, or under the condition that recompense is offered to the local or even global community such as the Steiner\u2013Vallentyne school.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism)\n>\n> [Market-oriented left-libertarianism, including Pierre-Joseph Proudhons mutualism and Samuel Konkin IIIs agorism, appeals to left-wing concerns such as class, egalitarianism, environmentalism, gender, immigration and sexuality within the paradigm of free-market anti-capitalism. Although libertarianism in the United States has become associated to classical liberalism and minarchism, with right-libertarianism being more known than left-libertarianism, political usage of the term until then was associated exclusively with anti-capitalism, libertarian socialism and social anarchism and in most parts of the world such an association still predominates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism)",

The fact that multiple events are generated in your mind is kinda my point.\n\nThe only point it makes is that the media spins this shit to suit a particular narrative and dumbasses perpetuate it without looking at the actual facts of the story. \n\n>I personally believe that only being in direct threat of death or protecting someone in direct threat of death are valid reasons to take someone's life. Even if a suspect has a warrant and runs, I don't think shooting him is justified especially if that warrant is non violent. \n\nboth examples i gave fit this category as i have explained. They did things that must be construed as a threat to the officers life i.e. reaching into a car or pointing a taser. \n\n>As far as active warrants they also don't justify killing someone. Warrants are wrong all the time and police in my opinion are not meant to be judge jury and executioner\n\nStrawman read my shit again i never said that. Jacob blake had an active warrant and was being arrested he resisted and made an action that must be construed as a threat to the officers life. \n\n> I do think police officers have a right to defend themselves, obviously. I just don't think that reaching into your car gives a police officer the right to kill you.\n\nWhat is your alternative? When the officer can't see your hands what are they supposed to do wait till the exact moment they are certain you have a gun? That's ridiculous, this isn't the movies, that's how you get shot or killed, shit happens way too fast for that to work at all. I'm not a fan of it but that's how the game is set up if you're legally allowed to carry a gun you have to do certain things for law enforcement to maintain peace, there's no getting out of this.",

Do you \u2018turn off\u2019 their police protection the way you\u2019d turn off their electricity? \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am.

But, I\u2019d hurry because she appears to be losing a lot of blood.\u2019\n\nOr, does it become a flat bill that is deducted from everyone\u2019s pay and sent to the \u2018police company\u2019 in their area? And, that raises other questions. What keeps that from just being just another tax, even if it is used to pay a private contractor? How does that work for people working in or traveling in areas outside of the jurisdiction of their home \u2018police company\u2019? And, what is to keep private police companies from turning into protection rackets like the mob used to do; victimizing people if they don\u2019t pay their protection money. This is a big question if there is to be private police forces competing for business.",

That seems pretty obvious. I understand why you are using recent examples but my thoughts on this are not based on recent events.  While your argument in the blake case is convincing, I'm talking more generally that reaching into your car alone does not justify being shot.  A lot of people have been saying that for decades so I felt it needed to be said.  Of course its a different issue with blake who allegedly resisted arrest put an officer in a headlock and and walked back to get into his car.  That's a different issue entirely.  I haven't looked into it in detail and honestly will wait to judge it till the court case is settled.",

It's a pipe dream. So I choose to vote for the candidate out of the two that I think will not continue the full throttle attack on democracy that is currently happening, Biden. He may even make a little bit of progress. I know the alternative will be in full reverse though. That's my take on it, and you're free to do what you think is best.

FEC\u00a0decisions, which upended longstanding campaign finance laws and gave corporations and the super-wealthy even more ability to influence elections. Obama may have voiced concerns, but throughout the 8 years he didn't move on that. He used the rhetoric for campaigning in 2008, and again in 2012.\n\nObamacare, while has good intent on creating a \"affordable\" and universal health system, was a bill that was packed ridden with riders and had several supreme court cases that found an overbearing of power from the bill. Over time it became more and more expensive for individuals (which I believe is a result of the healthcare industry in general not having good consumer policies.) Throughout the obama years there was support for individual provisions throughout the bill but overall voters opposed the bill.\n\nI'm very much an advocate for a universal healthcare system, but there are many other specifics that need to be taken care of before an overhaul like simply how hospitals price their services and drugs.

Maybe the lack of a kneejerk aversion to nuclear?  Or wanting to cut fossil fuel subsidies?\n\nOther than that, not much.  I don't see much in the way of tearing down barriers to small-scale power generation (be it individual or municipal).  There's a section on ramping up criminal prosecution for pollution, but it doesn't really go into specifics on what should be criminalized and what the penalties should be.  There's a lot of emphasis on providing pensions to coal miners, which would be entirely unnecessary if the Democrats actually listened to their Progressive base and pushed for UBI (especially as a replacement for *all* welfare systems, like [what libertarians have proposed](https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/libertarian-case-basic-income)).  Also a lot of emphasis on injecting $1.7 trillion into the economy for green energy, which also seems kind of pointless when we can and should instead be punishing polluters for their infringements on life/liberty/property and eliminating excessive regulatory barriers around green energy (in particular: invalidating green energy patents if they're being hoarded by fossil fuel companies instead of actually being used).",

In a situation where say, two candidates popular with party A are running but a third candidate in party B looks to win with 40% majority RCV would remove one candidate from party A which would either allow party A to better consolidate or ensure candidate from party B wins with more than 50% of the vote.\n\nIf you're saying RCV won't help Libertarians win well yeah that's true. Libertarian policies aren't very popular. However it would lead to more Liber votes as fewer people would have to worry about \"throwing their vote away\".\n\nApproval voting is fucking trash because it can lead to a less popular moderate candidate that no one actually wants winning, which is hilariously the only way I could see Libertarians getting close to the White House.

One of the fundamental beliefs of libertarians is \u2018to each their own.\u2019 If you don\u2019t want to have an abortion, don\u2019t. Nobody that I\u2019ve ever seen argues for forced abortion. But to not have the option is obtuse and narrow-sighted, and ultimately, in many cases, rooted in belief of some kind and certainly not in science. \n\nLibertarians agree with progressives on many, and I could probably argue most, issues. The primary ones that they divert on are of personal freedoms, e.g. firearm ownership, narcotic use(and by extension treatment vs. incarceration), and general day-to-day involvement in people\u2019s private lives and decisions that have little to no impact on the general public at large. Where progressives and conservatives alike lose libertarians is when they try to take the \u2018we know what\u2019s best for you better than you do\u2019 approach, which is, frankly, insulting. Progressives tend to try to convince you that they simply know what\u2019s best because this study or that research show this(all of which have contradicting counter-studies and research) while conservatives tend to take some kind of moral high ground(while taking bribes, engaging in unconstitutional voter suppression, etc.). \n\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019re getting there. People are becoming exhausted, especially after these last couple of election cycles, of choosing rotten donkey or rotten elephant. They\u2019re both rotten, but the system, run by rotten donkeys and rotten elephants who decide their own rules, demands we choose one or the other, else the people realize just how rotten their choices are.",

        "body": ">No it isn't. RCV by definition avoids splitting by a moderate candidate. If your candidate gets 50%+ of the vote then that's it, election over. But if it's split 3 ways then the least popular candidate is removed from the race with its voters secondary choices picked instead.\n\nLook up center squeeze. If the moderate is the least popular then the vote is split between the two extremes and which one you get will swing back and forth between elections. It is a stronger strategy to insincerely vote for the moderate as your favorite than to risk your least favorite candidate winning. This is actually exactly what happened in the 2009 mayoral race in Burlington, Vermont, which led to the repeal of RCV. \n\n>However it would lead to more Liber votes as fewer people would have to worry about \"throwing their vote away\".\n\nRCV is, as you say, fucking trash because spoilers still exist in it. RCV encourages people over time to stop voting for weaker candidates. RCV is nonmonotonic which means a candidate can go from being the winner to being a loser by receiving more votes and vice versa. Once that happens once or twice people will catch on.\n\nLook at [these](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/) diagrams and see how strange the results can get under RCV.\n\nApproval voting optimizes for finding the candidate with the most support instead of the candidate with the strongest support. If one candidate is the top choice of 51% and despised by the other 49% and the other candidate is moderately liked by 90%,who should win? It's a difference in philosophy and there's room for legitimate disagreement in which is better. However, even if you do want to optimize for strongest support, there are still much better methods that instant runoff.",

Head explodes, rage spews forth) \"YOU MUST VOTE IN THE SYSTEM THAT EXISTS! THERE WILL BE NO DEVIATION\"\n\nme: \"Doesn't sound very free or democratic to me. With my vote, I choose not to participate.\"",

You are in fact helping/hurting both dominate parties at the same time, voting third party without a ranked choice voting system is essentially vocalizing you're opposition to both parties.\n\n**But you are right that no party is entitled to your vote**, especially if you don't believe in their platform. Just don't delude yourself into thinking that voting third party in a Presidential election isn't throwing away a vote. \n\nAt the same time I can see why your friend believes you're a \"part of the problem\", they're afraid of what might happen if this administration is given another 4 years to centralize even more power into the executive branch so they've reverted to tribal politics and view even neutral parties as enemies.",

Recently, I mentioned that I had seen videos of Proud Boys beating people up in the streets and her response was \"I think they should have been out there from the beginning.\" That isn't the first thing that has alarmed me that my mother has said about violence committed by the right (yes, the left does their fair share) and I feel it is a change in her that scares me - that she is okay with violence committed by her side but condemns or looks down on any kind of protest or riot on the left. \n\nIf he is reelected, I will be 32 years old when he leaves office (and some would say if he leaves) and I will be thinking about bringing a child into the world at that point.

I have no idea how you would estimate the number of people philosophically libertarian to track how they vote. But if you consider the 600,000 we know to be libertarian you see the following: Barr in 08 got about 500,000 votes, and then Johnson in 2012 got approximately 1.2 million then 4.4 million in 2016. So based on numbers we can honestly look at, it appears most libertarians do indeed vote libertarian.\nYou could also look at Johnson getting 4.4 million and Trump winning as proof that they help, not hurt the GOP. I doubt we can be sure either way, so we should not make generalized assumptions.",

On the other hand if you don't see that happening either way then there's no reason to care and just vote for who you like.\n\nThis whole \"if you don't vote for jo, you're not Libertarian\" is, frankly, backwards logic.

Others think that government should do more to solve our country\u2019s problems. Which comes closer to your own view?\n\nSome people think the government should promote traditional values in our society. Others think the government should not favor any particular set of values. Which comes closer to your own view?\n\nCombining the responses to those two questions, Gallup found the ideological breakdown of the public shown below. With these two broad questions, Gallup consistently finds about 20 percent of respondents to be libertarian, and the number has been rising.\"\n\nThey do not go ask every voter if they are libertarian. So basically if you say the government should stay out of business and values, they count you as libertarian. Which even on its face doesn't seem accurate. But then you see:\n\n\"The Gallup Poll has a\u00a0new estimate of the number of libertarians in the American electorate. In their 2015 Governance survey they find that 27 percent of respondents can be characterized as libertarians, the highest number it has ever found. The latest results also make libertarians the largest group in the electorate, as compared to 26 percent conservative, 23 percent liberal, and 15 percent populist.\"\n\nAccording to Gallup libertarians are the largest part of the electorate. In that sense they should win every election. One problem is defining libertarian. Libertarians can't even decide what a libertarian is. People say Rand Paul is a libertarian, but he's clearly a republican. So there is some confusion over the big L Libertarian and little l libertarian but also over what little l libertarian, or philosophical libertarians even are. I'm sure there are other variables in this but I'm not quick to believe libertarians lead the electorate.",

The winner of the most votes wins the nomination. For people that talk about \"protecting democracy\" so much, the democrats have a shockingly undemocratic system.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the republicans still found a way to tank Ron Paul back in 2012. They have their methods for sure!",

He was patronized as a portrait painter by the court of The Hague.[2]\nContents\n\n    1 Life\n    2 Work\n    3 References\n    4 External links\n\nLife\n\nCels was born in Lier in the Duchy of Brabant in 1778. His family was one of the prominent families in Lier. He initially studied under the sculptor Pompe and then under P.-J. Denis. He later went to study under the Antwerp painter Andries Cornelis Lens who had settled in Brussels and was then very successful. He studied under Lens from 1795 to 1800.[1]\n\nHe travelled to Paris in September 1800 where he worked for a while under fellow Flemish painter Joseph-Beno\u00eet Suv\u00e9e, a Classicist painter. He then travelled on to Italy where he visited Florence and Naples and then settled in Rome where he remained for seven years. While in Rome, he sent his painting Cincinnatus (current location unknown) to the competition of the Academy of Ghent in 1802 where it won the golden prize.[3] One of his works - a Descent from the Cross (St. Paul's Church, Antwerp) - in the Pantheon in Rome.[1] He had been commissioned to paint the work as replacement for works by Rubens, which had been confiscated by the French occupiers.[4] This work was so admired that he was immediately admitted as member and professor of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca in Rome.[1] During his residence in Rome he painted many other commissions from Catholic institutions in Flanders and the Netherlands for religious works to replace paintings that had been lost to the French plunder.[1]\n\nHe returned to Flanders and lived and worked in Antwerp until 1815. That year he moved to The Hague, the administrative centre of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands of which the Southern Netherlands had become a part in 1815. Here he enjoyed the patronage of the royal court and was frequently commissioned to paint portraits of the royal family as well as other prominent sitters. He was admitted as a member of the Academy of Antwerp, the Academy of Amsterdam and correspondent of the Institut N\u00e9erlandais.[1]\n\nHe was appointed in 1820 to the professorship of drawing and director at the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts de Tournai (Academy of Fine Arts, Tournai), positions he held until he resigned in 1827. He subsequently settled in Brussels, where he resided until his death except for a trip to England in 1836.[1]\n\nHe was the father of Jean-Michel Cels, a landscape painter, and Josse Cels, an architect, who were trained by their father.[2]\nWork\n\nCornelis was a painter of religious subjects as well as portraits. He also produced a few genre paintings. His work was influenced by the Neo-Classicist style becoming prevalent at the end of the 18th century. His masters Lens and Suv\u00e9e were both representatives of this style in Flanders.[2]\n\n    Portrait of Aryna van der Pot\n\n    Portrait of Jessy Macpherson\n\n    Swiss farm girl\n\n    Portrait of the painter Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Jacobs [fr]\n\nReferences\n\nAdolphe Siret, Corneille Cels at the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 3, pp. 403\u2013405 (in French)\nCornelis Cels at the Netherlands Institute for Art History (in Dutch)\nLi\u00e9vin Armand Marie De Bast, Annales du salon de Gand et de l'\u00e9cole moderne des Pays-Bas: Recueil de morceaux choisis parmi les ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, architecture et gravure, expos\u00e9s au Mus\u00e9e en 1820, P.

So first we have a poll to find out how many people we can get to pledge their vote to our cause. Some estimates ([Gallup poll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_in_the_United_States)) put it at roughly 20% of the population, but we probably only need less than 10%. The tighter the race, the less we will need.\n\nThen we negotiate with the major parties for the incorporation of Libertarian policies. The party that most closely aligns with Libertarian values will get all pledged Libertarian votes as a block. \n\nThe outcome would be publically debated and deliberated on and decided by a randomly selected, but statistically significant, portion of pledged voters (via [Sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)), with input from a panel consisting of libertarian think tanks (Cato, Mises, etc) and the libertarian party.\n\nThe good thing about this strategy is we don't need critical mass right away. We can build up momentum over time and when the time is right and our win-ability is there for everyone to see, then we can go for the jugular to displace one of the major parties.",

        "body": "Trump is a fascist. He couldn't turn the United States government fascist in 4 years but he's done a damn good job of corrupting every institution in that direction. He's basically used Umberto Eco's 14 Points of Fascism as a roadmap.\n\nI mean, c'mon:\n\n> 1. \"The Cult of Tradition\", characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by Tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.\n\n> 2. \"The Rejection of modernism\", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.\n\n> 3. \"The Cult of Action for Action's Sake\", which dictates that action is of value in itself, and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.\n\n> 4. \"Disagreement Is Treason\" \u2013 Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.\n\n> 5. \"Fear of Difference\", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.\n\n> 6. \"Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class\", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.\n\n> 7. \"Obsession with a Plot\" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society (such as the German elite's 'fear' of the 1930s Jewish populace's businesses and well-doings; see also anti-Semitism). Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.\n\n> 8. Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as \"at the same time too strong and too weak.\" On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.\n\n> 9. \"Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy\" because \"Life is Permanent Warfare\" \u2013 there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.\n\n> 10. \"Contempt for the Weak\", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate Leader who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.\n\n> 11. \"Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero\", which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, \"[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.\"\n\n> 12. \"Machismo\", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold \"both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.\"\n\n> 13. \"Selective Populism\" \u2013 The People, conceived monolithically, have a Common Will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the Leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of \"no longer represent[ing] the Voice of the People.\"\n\n> 14. \"Newspeak\" \u2013 Fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.\n\nWhich box does Trump not check? How about Jason Stanley's (the Yale professor who literally wrote the book \"How Fascism Works\") characterization:\n\n> He defines fascism as \"a cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation.\"\n\nTrump is fascist by any reasonable modern day definition. Trying to argue he isn't because he isn't rounding up political enemies to kill yet is head-in-the-sand naive. \n\nHe's encouraging all kinds of violence, by police and by his supporters. He gleefully cheers on police violence as \"retribution.\" He defends vigilantes when they attack his political enemies. He's tried to employ the military. He's sent in DHS forces in unmarked to abduct people off the street. His AG is pressuring his prosecutors to charge protesters with sedition. He's encouraging his brownshirt supporters to violently engage with protesters in an almost eerie recreation of Hitler's brownshirts.\n\nFascism is happening in America.",

We are not under fascism. It is literally an impossibility under our constitution. Arresting someone is not fascism. Really none of what you said is fascism. \n\nYou are watering down the term to mean what you want it to mean. And some professor from yale, writes a book in 2020 on how fascism works, and he is now the authority on fascism? That guy is just a leftist who wants to uses scare tactics trying to spin fascism and connect it to this current administration, talking about what lays the groundwork for fascism. By no means an authority on fascism. Anyone can speculate on what creates conditions for anything. That is easy. It doesn't make it true.\n\nFascism isn't that complicated. Without breaking down different definitions, at the core of fascism is an oppressive, authoritarian, totalitarian, dictatorial government with absolute full control over its citizens. Something we do not have in this country, nor anything close. It cannot happen under the current structure of our government, regardless of how you want to spin it.\n\nIf I had to guess you are a leftist who is claiming to be libertarian, yet voting for Biden. I know plenty of libertarians, and hear from many, and while many may not be fond of trump. I never hear any justifiable excuse from them for voting for Biden.",

Ever since Ron Paul, I have always voted for the libertarian party but this election year everything going on with BLM and looting, I am voting for Trump.\n\nAlso, after voting for and supporting the libertarian party for 12 years, I think we have no chance of going at it solo. I think our best chance is to work within the Republican party. People like Ron Paul, Thomas Massie, Rand Paul has had more impact on our causes then the libertarian party as a whole.

My point I'm trying to illustrate that, is that if we keep choosing the lesser evil, Americans will still pick a great evil if its 1% less evil than the other guy.

Stating that States run elections while our own intelligence agency confirmed that Russia was interfering the 2016 election by posting false information on social media and hacking sensitive information from the DNC and RNC all of which the president denied.  the Republican Party almost unanimously agreed that Trump would run unopposed in the 2020 elections by canceling a handful of State primaries. In doing so they literally gave nobody an option which declared Trump King of Republicans which is ironic considering the very definition of Republican philosophy is that the United States is a public matter that will not be run by a monarch, ruler or King.  And do you really want to talk about doomsaying? Donald Trump's party stokes division and fear in every one of it's commercial broadcasts. They've essentially said that if Joe Biden wins  a bunch of black people are going to show up and burn down your house. They're one step away I'm saying that if Joe Biden wins socialist radical leftists will break into your house and rape grandma. Shit on your floor. Kick the family dog and set off a nuclear bomb in your living room. In one of Donald Trump's ads literally uses protests from Barcelona Spain because it was more cinematically pleasing. So please spare me with a doomsaying bullshit. Joe Jorgenson is not going to become the next president United States no matter how much you want to believe it. AT LEAST NOT IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE. And I actually like Joe Jorgenson. But if Donald Trump is elected for four more years you may never have a chance to nominate Joe Jorgenson again because there may be no systems in place to allow you to do so. You want a third-party candidate so badly  that you're willing to risk eliminating the libertarian party all together. Authoritarians do not concede power at the end of an election cycle. So while I think Joe Biden it's definitely not the ideal candidate I find issue and calling him the authoritarian when at the end of his term I know he'll leave office. Donald Trump on the other hand has proven he will do whatever it takes for him and his family to permanently reside in the White House.",

Gatekeeping has an important role to play in a community. When we fail to ever attempt to maintain some meaning, some foundation, then terms become meaningless. Everyone says they love \"liberty\". Ask any progressive Democrat and ask any ultra conservative Republican, and they'll say they love liberty. But \"loving liberty\" isn't what defines libertarian philosophy. Obviously, nor is hating Trump. \n\nBut a discussion about how one can believe in libertarian principles and philosophy, while simultaneously supporting someone like Trump, who so clearly rejects that philosophy is a valuable discussion. Finding out if people who call themselves \"libertarians\" actually have read any libertarian philosophy and actualky ascribe to it, is valuable.",

Notice I said should not can; you\u2019re obviously entitled to vote for whomever u please. But if you truly believe in libertarianism then that mindset should prevent you from voting for statists.",

While he has taken steps to decrease troop presence he has also expanded the drone war.
