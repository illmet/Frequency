Say what you will about Republicans, but they always get out to vote. Even when it looks like they'll lose, even when they haven't researched the issues or the candidates, they get out and vote, every time. And that's how they win.

Just remember to look on the bright side at least you didnt have to suffer through a Hillary Clinton presidency. Yes, it was your right to refuse to vote for her, either by voting 3rd party or not voting at all, but like all other freedoms, the right to vote does not mean freedom from social consequences.

It is fucking insane that people are seriously voting for Trump at all. He is an endlessly corrupt reality TV, trust fund moron. No morals, endless scandals and completely offputting behavior all around. He has exploited every gullible republican with identity politics as his weapon. No other president has ever deliberately divided us more. I am so embarrassed and full of rageshame that half of the country literally fell for his lies, deflections and repetitive rhetoric.

Joe Biden then claims to have never interacted with Burisma ... but the emails show this is a lie Then the Biden campaign chooses not to denounce the emails whatsoever WTF So how is this not grift It's literally cashforinfluence, but apparently President Trump is the one that is compromised Am I living in loony land, how is this not massive news Where is the politics subreddit on this this at all ALSO I'm trying to find more information ... but Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Wikipedia and just about every single big media source are blocking the story for my safety.

He picked her for only two reasons Gender and Race thats it. She is more radical than Bernie Sanders and the vast majority of Democrats didnt even vote for her because of her terribly run presidential campaigns, she had 3 in the polls didnt get any of the black vote and dropped out before the primary of her own home state which she is a senator for. She is extremely radical but I have no clue why Joe Biden thought this would gain him popularity or why this was a good idea, she insulted him and she was always against him during her campaign and now this all magically goes away. She was a terrible choice for VP and I dont know why even thought I like Joe Biden that it would be a good idea to vote for this terrible VP choice by him.', \"Last debate I posted about how terribly Trump was doing and how he needed to let Biden talk and focus on the issues. This time Trump is doing it and so much more. This is the best and most Presidential I've ever seen him. He is sticking to the issues, addressing the points directly, and being articulate and authentic while throwing some incisive shade at Biden where it's called for. He's destroying Biden who's dodging every question with typical platitudes and transparent political bullshit, on which Trump called him out DIRECTLY.

Why do Republicans keep trying to come up with some bull shit excuse They dont need to explain themselves to a partisan media.

Also even though there's not proof, I know in my heart that what's he allegedly said about the troops is true. I don't really like Biden, or his policies, but Trump must be stopped. I'm voting for Biden, also I live in Pennsylvania, for what that's worth.

The phone bank was intended only for reaching out to Biden voters, to help them register and request their ballots. I asked this voter the usual questions and he said he was both registered and had requested his ballot. Finally, I asked him if he was supporting Joe Biden. He paused and said he was unsure. Going off script, I asked him if there was any questions I could answer about Joe. He was a supporter of Bernie Sanders in the primary. I replied that I was as well. He asked me what positions Biden had taken that are the same as Bernie. I quickly pointed out that he supports 15hr minimum wage like Bernie had pushed for since 2016. He also favors of lowering the age of Medicare to 60, which is a step in Bernies goal of setting the age to 0. Biden wants a public option, also a step towards single payer. I also noted that Biden has always been ideologically flexible. His voting record in the Senate was always in the exact middle of the party. A majority of Democratic primary voters supported single payer. Biden tries to move with the center of mass of the party. Biden is an excellent lower case democrat in that sense. Finally, he asked about Bidens plans for students. I actually didnt know either so I looked it up with him on the phone. We were both impressed to learn his plan is very progressive He wants free public colleges and student loan forgiveness after 20 years. The conversion ended with him telling me he was changing his vote from Trump to Biden I felt elated to have flipped a Trump voter. There are still open minded persuadable voters out there.

Im totally on board with that I think both political parties right now have policies that are a serious threat to individual liberties. On top of that, I think Trump as a human in general is not a great guy.

Its frustrating to come to a place where there is supposed to be real political discussion, especially of libertarian ideals, and instead, be greeted by a top post on hot at the time of writing that has NOTHING to do with libertarian philosophy or even politics in general When I come to I dont care that Trump said he had the biggest tower in Manhattan after 911.

But it doesnt belong here I can read that and a variety of other Trump Bad posts by going to What does Trump saying that have to do with libertarianism I feel like leading up to the election this sub has gradually decreased in quality and is slowly turning into the rest of Reddit, an obsession with Donald Trump.

This results in 8 of the seats in Parliament House of Representatives being held by ACT. Prior to the election, ACT held 0.5 of the vote and just one seat out of the 120 total seats. During the last parliamentary term, bills would be passed 1191, with the single ACT member of parliament the only voice opposing laws severely restricting freedom. The major conservative opposition party, National, collapsed in a year where there were 3 different leaders, including one who kept a Trump MAGA hat displayed prominently in his office. As a member of ACT, I'm proud of what we achieved this election, and the new reinforcements will be key voices to hold prime minister Ardern's Labour government to account. There is huge momentum for libertarianism here, and I sincerely wish libertarians in other countries hold on to hope, because there are many of us fighting to preserve freedoms and choice.\", \"If you support Trump, you arent libertarian Im serious. So Ive seen 'libertarians' on YouTube, reddit, and twitter say that they will be voting for Trump and that Trump is more libertarian than the libertarian party. Now I understand the criticisms of the LP and a lot of them are valid. But to say that Trump is libertarian is laughable. So Im going to go over Trumps term and point to policies which he pushed which are anti liberty and anti libertarian. 1. The National Debt Donald Trump is the worst president in history when it comes to the national debt. In 4 years, he added more to the national debt then Obama did in 8 and Bush did 8. Trump increased the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. 2. The Second Amendment Trump is anti second amendment, and so is the Republican Party. Trump passed the first gun control in decades which banned bump stocks. Trump hates the second amendment. 3. The Patriot ActNSA Spying Trump claims he hates unwarranted surveillance yet he expanded the patriot act and extended it. Trump expanded it and can now spy on us since 2018. 4. Trumps drone strikes Obama is known as the 'bomber in chief' which is true. But Trump has actually surpassed Obama in drone strikes and actually is the biggest drone striker in history. 5. Trump didnt end the wars Trump didnt end the wars and has actually expanded them in different countries and added troops there. 6. Hates Free Market capitalism Trump doesnt support capitalism and instead supports corporatism. He supported massive bailouts of corporations which increased the debt and kept failing companies afloat. Hes a corporatist who supported the cares act, the biggest transfer of wealth in history. Trump is a fraud and libertarians should hate him as much as Biden.\", 'I thought it was entertaining.

The only way for the Republican Party to stay in power is to convince people they actually care about them and when that doesnt work they either convince people not to care at all aka dont show up to vote, intimidate people at the polls, and then try and throw out ballots. I dont believe that Trump even has the favor of half the country, its just Trumpists are the loudest and Republican loyalists are being complicit.

Its been uncovered already that Fox News is propaganda. I notice that when they decide which parts to cover. Most headlines are talking about how Trump is trailing in the polls and Fox News chooses to say this black man supports Trump or something of the like. Fox News has been a key player in setting up this divisive stance. Theres a youre either with us or against us belief that theyve manifested, but its turned into more than that. Trump has made it all about him. If youre a real American, you support him. If you dont, then fuck you and get out. His supporters have adopted this rhetoric as well. Supporting Trump means youre a Godfearing Christian and you love your country. Being a liberal means you want to take our guns, turn everyone gay, kill all the babies, and make us communists. Another reason in which Trump still has supports is the way people view reality. Theres an article from the Atlantic that describes their reality as climbing the hill of the American dream. Ill link it here article I dont want to pinpoint a lack of education as a player. Because thats just a consequence of the underlying systemic issues. The USs infrastructure was built on oppression by race, wealth, and status. It picks and chooses whos on top and keeps people down on the bottom. Our capitalist state relies on sacrifice zones and wasted lives in order to thrive. We profit on prisons and coal mining towns. We repeatedly decide how much a life is worth.

The White House was also unable to make an official statement. That is what everyone is criticizing. His stance on white supremacists is not official, when it should absolutely be.

The US is actively bombing 8 countries. Can you name them all Under Obama our drones had 90 civillian casualties, according to our own militaries internal reporting. They gave a war criminal the nobel peace prize, incredible. In Syria, after the US convinced Gaddafi to get rid of nuclear armament and then subsequently killed him, there are now openair slave markets in a completely failed state. Trump has not gotten us into a new war, but Iran is understandably concerned that we stopped giving them their money in the Iran deal, and will drop their end of the bargain out of fear of ending up like Gaddafi. It doesn't really help tensions that we just assassinated their top general, lol. A bad guy, but he was also most well known in the region for fighting Isis. This is beyond a partisan problem. It is not in either parties interests to spend so much on the military industrial complex, but every politician finds a way to justify it, with Bush and Obama being the most egregious.

Prosecutor Yarema seeks to investigate Hunter Biden Burisma for corruption. No. Yarema was NOT investigating. He was fired for NOT investigating. The new leaders in Ukraine wanted to clamp down on the corruption that was rampant in the previous administration, and Yarema was not doing that. So he was fired. Joe Biden threatens to hold 1 billion aid to Ukraine if Yarema is not let go. No. The Obama administration quickly made friends with the new Ukrainian administration for reasons I haven't looked into and won't try to explain, and was in favor of the firing of Yarema because he wasn't doing his job. Joe Biden couldn't withhold aid to stop an investigation, because no investigation was taking place. Joe Biden then claims to have never interacted with Burisma ... but the emails show this is a lie The emails suggest that Hunter Biden was allegedly, whatever open to setting up a meeting with Joe. They don't say whether or not a meeting was actually set up or actually took place. Am I living in loony land, how is this not massive news Two reasons. 1 The sourcing for the article is extremely questionable. The FBI just announced they're investigating Giuliani and the sourcing of the emails because they think this was allegedly, whatever a Russian intelligence operation. In other words, Russian intelligence hackedstolewhatever these emails, and turned them over to Giuliani, who then gave them to the press. The story that Hunter Biden gave his computers to a repairman, who then turned them over to Giuliani is... um... pretty obviously bullshit. 2 The content of the emails isn't actually that bad. They don't say anything about an actual meeting taking place. They also don't say anything about a meeting not taking place, but we can reasonably assume that there's no email that shows a meeting took place, because Giuliani would obviously leak that. Now, had a meeting taken place, would that be bad for Joe Biden Yeah, that looks bad. But is at an OMG MASSIVE SCANDAL that sinks Joe Biden No. Not even close. Trump has been engaged in all kinds of garden variety corruption for the last 4 years most voters don't care at this point, because there's more important things going on. There's an article every week about Trump profiting in one way or another from being President that echoes around the liberal bubble for a few days and then disappears Secret service spends 80,000 of tax payer money on golf carts at Trump Resort, blah blah blah. People don't care. They want a job and healthcare the rest is just noise. I had to visit Tim Pool's YT page and some Aussie Sky News site to see it. Huh Is this not blatant censorship Yes, it's censorship. Twitter, Facebook, etc are private platforms. They're not bound by the same first amendment laws as the government i. they can censor what they want. For example, terrorist propaganda is posted to these sites all the time and quickly deleted. I'm NOT comparing this story to terrorist propaganda, merely pointing out that censorship happens all the time on social media.\", \"You're all fucking morons.\", 'You neglect to mention that the entire free world wanted Prosecutor Yarema fired... particularly, because he failed to investigate corruption at Burisma... knowing this fact, the rest of your argument turns to bullshit.. You can research yourself that one of the main reasons for everyone, not just Biden, wanting Yarema fired was because he failed to look into corruption at Barisma... But Im sure its much more fulfilling to ignore that fact as it doesnt fit into your predetermined outlook...', \"Sorry OP but you have no understanding of this. Yes Hunter used his family name to get an rasy and high paying job. This is BS but if you are considered about it, you should look at Trump who's nepotism is off the charts. Now whats wrong Yarema had made no public statements about thinking about investigating Burisma. In fact this only came out AFTER he was fired. He infact was extremely corrupt himself and wouldn't investigate any companies while he was in his position. This is why Biden did what he did. He did what he did at the direction of Obama, our EU allies, AND REPUBLICAN SENATORS. So please tell me if every one of those people that directed Biden also had children working at that company who was not under any public investigation at the time. This is a known Russian smear campiagn that Russian agents fed this BS to Rudy Giuliani look at the new headlines about him. Rudy thinking that he had a hot lead built a team many of whom are now arrested for illegally funneling money into donations to try to get information about it. To assist Rudy, Trump dismantled the normal Diplomatic channels that would have stopped Rudy and pressured the Ukraine President to work with his personal lawyer to investigate his political rival. This is unheard of and criminal. Now what do these latest emails show that only conservatives care about It shows that Hunter Introduced his business partner to his father. Thats about it.

It was to protect the company at a time when it was facing investigations, said Onyshchenko, who left the country in 2016. The Ministry of Internal Affairs removed Zlochevskyi from its wanted list. The General Prosecutors Office initially investigated Zlochevskyis alleged illicit enrichment, but shifted its investigation to that of a more minor offense, tax evasion, and eventually closed the case in 2016. The criminal case was closed exactly 1 week before Trump was elected ie, when Biden was no longer responsible for Ukraine foreign policy. A corrupt businessman doesn't appoint powerful political figures to a board, and pay them generously, because they're kindhearted. They serve a purpose, and it's not just for advice. If that were the case, they could instead hire experts, with decades of education and experience. No one in the Prosecutor Generals Office has been punished for the dumping of Zlochevskyis case.

Additionally, the federal stockpile was distributed unevenly, favoring states like Florida who received 100 of their requests, unlike Massachusetts and Maine who only received 17 and 5 respectively.

Trump never EVER implicated it should be taken seriously which in turn made his less than average intelligence supporters, think it wasnt serious. If he would have encouraged the use of masks been a real leader and set guidelines for all states to follow, maybe not been a narcissist and stepped aside to let the experts talk, we would have a unified front. No one is saying there probably wouldnt have been people who died. And I agree that the numbers from China and Russia could be inaccurate. But there are plenty of other reputable countries that are high income countries like us, where the US has extremely higher death rates from covid and just general death causes. Implying he knew more than scientists who study diseases and epidemics for a living, denouncing anything they said, specifically asked if people could drink disinfectant, spreading misinformation is deadly and he is the cause. And before the whole Fauci said no masks comes up, if you look at the whole picture, it was because the US didn't have enough PPE at the time, so Fauci was asking the public to save the actual medical masks and n95 masks for hospital workers. Lastly, one measly stimulus check did nothing in the long term. You guys are the laziest mofos, there is mountains of evidence showing how inadequately he handled this virus and you call on people who dont support him to show you the evidence that you will only say is fake news. The travel ban from china just meant people flew to places like italy first before coming back, it made it harder to do contact tracing and harder to track and meant more spreading of the virus. As someone who has lived with a chronic illness that meant I wore oxygen by age 22, a mask is literally the least amount you can do. Be grateful for your health I will die before my husband, before my friends and before you say anything, I had a lung transplant almost 7 years ago, and I have been working full time since 7 months after my transplant. I am a productive member of society.\", 'Doesnt matter. You jumped in to my response. Please answer the questions. I never once asked for sources. I asked for evidence that any of what he lied was true. He responded with links to articles that he didnt read. Thats neither argument nor evidence. As we all know, starting a response with lol is indeed a huge tell for cognitive dissonance. Youre also clearly experiencing it right now. Its obvious from your straw man arguments.', 'This happened.', 'Thats....not an explanation. Its two words. Be specific.', 'So first off show me where all these countries are doing so much better than we are And lets look at deaths per million not the overall count because we have a MUCH higher population count than these other countries so obviously the overall number would be more. Also while were at it, lets look at the numbers for people who died FROM COVID vs the reporting of those who simply died WITH COVID. HUGE differences in numbers there. And while the disinfectant comment wasnt helpful, it also wasnt as bad as the media made it out to be. I watched the press conference at the time and it was blown way out of proportion. If you think the travel bans didnt do any good, it would have been way worse if they werent enacted. Most people dont have the money to fly half way around the world to try and get past a travel ban so thats a lame argument. So if you have all these mountains of evidence show me something thats concrete where Trump endangered the population of the US. Fauci has stated numerous times in numerous interviews that Trump didnt say anything any differently than he was told from the experts at the time.', 'So provide all this evidence.', 'Haha your life must be very fun Well, since you dont consider articlessources evidence, what exactly do you consider evidence Just so you cant keep moving the goal posts here.

You seriously needed that spelled out for you', \"There is your evidence, and that includes overall deaths not just what was noted as covid and it's also accounts for population bro. We won't change each others minds because dying with covid and from covid are the same thing and if you can't understand the idea that someone who has other health factors and gets covid and then dies due to covid exacerbating their previous conditions still means it's a covid death because without ever contracting covid, they would still be alive, then that's on your lack of being able to understand basic cause and effect. I have cystic fibrosis and I have had a double lung transplant. So if I get covid and die, due to covid creating a secondary bacterial infection in my lungs which then triggers my immune response to recognize the lungs arent in fact mine, triggering rejection of my lungs, I still die from covid and rejection... do you get it study done by scientists\", \"It is, thanks.

Also Im not a moron and know that people can die of complications from having COVID. However there have been dozens of reports that have come out where people have been counted in the COVID death number simply for testing positive for COVID at the time of death, but NOT dying from anything related to it. Such as someone dying from a heart attack with no COVID symptoms. Or a car accident or suicide and they tested positive for COVID during the autopsy. And this has been done so the hospitals can get more money from the feds for the COVID deaths.

And gives me more reason to research and potentially change my opinion. I will argue the whole hospitals get more money thing seems fishy, I haven't seen any sources or reputable links to vouch for that, only heresay, and honestly seems like another conspiracy theory. That said, I find it hard to believe only because having medical issues means I talk to a lot of hospital workers, I can't imagine a hospital worker doing that to give their boss more money when they are already being shafted by their employers, and not particularly happy with hospital administration, if that makes sense. Also my mother died unexpectedly this year, its super expensive to get an autopsy done when there is no suspicion of foul play, so again highly doubt there are a bunch autopsies being done to try to give someone a covid death. And so you know, my mother had no covid on her death certificate. Lastly, dozens of reports over our whole country won't be adding a lot to the covid death count. Its not like that would account for 100,000 deaths, maybe a few hundred max. But again, highly doubt it.

However its possible that its been slightly misrepresented Source Also I misspoke when I said autopsies rather than simply a cause of death being reported on the death certificate. The bottom line is that it was expected that if we did nothing we would have over 2 million deaths to COVID and the best case scenario was closer to 200k. I tried to find where I had seen those numbers but was unable to do so. However I did find this from the BBC that shows how the US has actually done pretty well compared to the rest of the world. Source Those trying to say Trump has totally failed the US in how this has been handled is truly incorrect when you look at the statistics. Obviously as Trump has said MANY times, one death is too many but considering we are dealing with a situation that has never been dealt with in modern times, hes done much better than anyone on the left will ever give him credit for', \"You literally just asked for posted evidence and I gave it to you.

They claimed to have a better option but 4 years after Trump was put in office, nothing is better. I wish Paul Ryan hadnt retired but I respect him for it. I thought he was going to be the person to pull the Republican Party back into the forefront of American politics. I mightve liked Rubio even more.

Lindsey Graham RS.C. If an opening comes in the last year of President Trumps term, and the primary process has started, well wait to the next election. 2016, Sen. Marco Rubio RFla. I dont think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this presidents term I would say that if it was a Republican president. 2016, Sen. David Perdue RGa. The very balance of our nations highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people. 2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley RIowa A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldnt be denied a voice. 2016, Sen. Thom Tillis RN.C. The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president. 2016, Sen. Richard Burr RN.C. In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president. 2016, Sen. Roy Blunt RMo. The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president. 2016, Sen. Cory Gardner RCol. I think were too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision. 2016, Sen. Rob Portman ROhio I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldnt be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and its been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year. 2016, Sen. Ron Johnson RWisc. I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president. Mitch McConnell, March 2016', 'Why do Republicans keep trying to come up with some bull shit excuse Because thats what the GOP is good at dragging their feet and not conserving anything.

For trump side I dont have a problem with him. He can nominates all he wants. I have a problem with McConnell and Graham. Both are fucking liars and weasels only doing trumps biding. McConnell should have said that he wouldnt accept any new nomination to the senate only because of the precedent he set or if you want to be fair the ruling the Biden came up with. 4 years ago when I heard this I thought this is fucking stupid rule but fuck it. Im not gonna protest because it just gives voters more ambition to vote for the next president. Now it is a clear attempt on the republicans side to try and get control no matter what. It is also aggravating that McConnell didnt even wait a day or two to announce that he would accept new picks but within an hour of hearing RBGs death.', \"What do you think Trump got impeached for Eating too many McDonald's\", \"yes, politics is all about revenge. Trump and McConnell couldn't even wait till her body was cold to say they were going to push through a vote before the election and will continue even if Trump is a lame duck president after the election. The republicans and democrats are playing a game of chess, but the republicans decided fuck it and burned down the house. The dems are still inside playing by the rules trying to win a game of chess in a burning building.

I personally decided to vote against Trump last year when they impeached him. I knew then that being with Trump was being on the wrong side of history. I was disappointed. Frustrated with how things turned out. I voted for Joe Biden during the primaries. Back then I wasn't sure about him, but now I can't be more sure When I decided to support Biden, I at least wanted to do some research on him. It was then that I learned how caring Biden is, how kind he is, how he has morals and respect and thoughtfulness and integrity. Thank you for realizing what Trump is and how incompetent he is.

The Republican party may say it's for some things that I may agree with. The republican party doesn't act on stated principals. They only campaign and fund raise on them. I've been lucky. I've been able to travel the country and the world a bit. I've been to 32 states and 12 different foreign countries. I've lived in 6 different states. I've learned there are shades of red Montana is red, South Carolina in crimson. I've also learn the democratic party, comparatively, isn't very left wing at all. Different experiences like seeing more of the world does help you grow. I understand that people evolve over time. People don't always recognize the writing on the wall at the same time. In fact I'm sure there is someone here wondering why it took me all the way to 2000. I'd advise some continued introspection. trump very likely played to some dark baser instincts. If you can identify that, you can probably help your friends. I'm probably older. By the time trump became a candidate, I was familiar with the total asshat he's always been.

After knowing what I know and seeing how horrible the trump admin treats people and how corrupt every aspect of this administration is, theres really no way i could vote for him and sleep at night. Trumps handling of covid19 and black lives matters was just the cherry on top. I dont think either candidate is perfect but I think Biden at least is a decent man who has experience in politics and tries to help people. We need to at least have him as president to get some of these corrupt politicians out of there. Im glad were still bringing people over from the trump train.

While I cant say I really support a lot of conservative positions anymore, in an ideal world both sides should be able to deliberate and create policies that work for the nation.

We know he said awful, immature, and disparaging things about McCain and a goldstar family in the past. This all makes the accusations that he insulted our soldiers very believable. Also, Trump's attempt to unilaterally ban Tik Tok and other phone apps really bothers me. I don't care about Tik Tok itself, but the idea that he could just sign a piece of paper and tell all of us which programs we can and can't use on our own private property is just not acceptable. Every individual should be free to make the choice to risk their own personal data if they want to. If Trump feels that it is a matter of national security, he can just order it banned on government worker's phones, and mind is own business in regards to what private citizens do with their own private property. Then there is also his open embrace of ridiculous conspiracy theories knowingly pushing lies onto the American people to serve his own political interests with complete disregard to the damage it is doing to society. He also regularly retweets posts from known white supremacists and open racists. He even literally tweeted a video of one of his supporters shouting 'white power'. I think that anybody who supports Trump at this point either agrees with these awful things, or they are just lying to themselves about him.

I'm no economist, but in general taxing corporations from what I've heard is not always the best in every circumstance, but one argument that makes a lot of sense for me is this Companies like Amazon do a lot of good they make things easier to buy and provide good service. Also make things easier to sell. And they provide a lot of jobs. Democrats don't want to stop that by any means. But they do want to make sure that those jobs are decent paying and the workers have good working conditions. This is where unions come in as one solution instead of the govt deciding the exact conditions, let the workers decide what's most important to them. They also want to make sure that those companies are paying their share for the public good that help them deliver things. So when an Amazon warehouse opens up in a city, there will be a lot more demand for roads and bridges, which costs money. Since Amazon is profiting from these public goods, the taxpayers should not be the only ones paying to build and maintain these roads and bridges. Amazon should pay. Or maybe the CEO pays a lot in taxes to help fund schools, preK, and healthcare subsidies for people in the community. Basically the economics come out to this our system heavily rewards those at the top of the economy. That's fine, they have to work hard and are very hard to replace. But Democrats in general think we should structure the system to reward them a little less they'll still have a huge amount of money, in order to make sure the huge number of people in the middle and bottom have good quality lives.

That is why it's so bad that you have just two parties. There is almost no battlefield of ideas and just a team you are a part of. Let's have a quick rundown. I think the ban of abortions is goverment overreach. I personally wouldnt like to have one for a partner or smth, but I don't think the government has a say in this decision. Gun control certainly works, but it's also a question about freedom. Lots of liberals think that people should be able to own guns, but that certain regulations make the country safer for everyone. Criminals or people with mental problems also shouldn't have them. The Iraq war was truly stupid and so is every single war in the middle east. Movies where Soldiers fight occupation forces are watched by millions, but people don't see how this applies in the real world to the middle east. Every terrorist you kill has family and friends and the only way to end the circle of radicalization is by lifting people out of poverty and giving a democracy.

If separation of Church and State are not embraced as the law of the land, their posterity might well be governed by those with beliefs totally contrary to their own. If the pandemic has taught us anything about the Pandemic, it is that the current economic policies that are creating an ever widening wealth gap are not sustainable without destroying the nation. If the US is to be a nation of laws, if individual liberty and equal right under law are to prevail rather than having human desperation leading to anarchy, changes will need to be made ... and the GOP actions evidence they seem to prefer the ever widening wealth gap. Every percentage tax cut for the wealth, exponentially increases their favorable position economically increases the head start of the families of the very rich in the economic rat race.

I had just finished college and was making my way to New York to begin my new engineering job. Slowly my paranoia and fear that people were out to get me overtook me and in a panic, I drove to an airport and rushed to the nearest security officer. From there I was put in an ambulance and taken to a hospital where I received my diagnosis of schizophrenia. Once released from the hospital, I rushed to my new career and disregarded my new diagnosis. My diagnosis was just a fluke, I told myself. Two years later, back at home in Indiana, the symptoms returned. This time worse than the first time. I was sent to an inpatient psychiatric hospital and had my schizophrenia diagnosis confirmed. It was here that I was fortunate enough to learn about first episode psychosis FEP clinics. Even though this was technically my second psychotic event, it was only two years since my first psychotic episode. Therefore, fortunately, I was accepted to the FEP clinic in Indianapolis named PARC Prevention and Recovery Center for early psychosis. In order to focus on my health and be close to family and friends, I resigned from my job in New York to stay in Indiana and get help at PARC. This was the beginning of my road to recovery. I started all the main aspects of coordinated specialty care CSC that a FEP clinic offers cognitive behavioral therapy, low dose antipsychotic medication a long acting injectable, case management, continued employment in the form of a new engineering job close to home, and family and peer support. In addition, I participated in research at the FEP clinic to help further the understanding of the disease. I also joined my local NAMI and MHA support groups. After my second psychotic episode, I made the choice to not only get better but be a better person these support structures were there to assist me in that goal. During the last 15 months I have been receiving care at PARC, I believe I have gotten much better. My psychotic symptoms such as paranoia and delusions have gone away. I have grown closer to my family with the help of therapy and an excellent therapist. My existing friendships have also been strengthened, and I have made new friends through my support groups. My antipsychotic dosage has been lowered and may be reduced again in the future. In addition, my therapy appointments have been reduced from four times a month to two. In the next few years, I would like to reduce therapy as I have discovered my own healthy coping habits to overcome any difficulties I may encounter. As with therapy, my psychiatrist appointments will also be reduced from once a month to once every two or three months. I plan to continue going to my local support groups because they are close to home and help me to feel less alone and part of a community. Eventually I plan to move into my own place and once again be completely selfsufficient. With the help of my FEP clinic team, community, family, and friends, I have gotten back on track.

I just don't see how a free market is going to work in health insurance when the entire point is to pool risk to decrease individual cost which will naturally drift towards monopoly with a free market system.

I think private practice can be a good thing and market forces can work at that level because patients have a real choice and can choose the practitioner they go to. I think we need a blended system using market forces for enterprises that can have positive market forces working on them and to nationalize things that tend to monopolize and benefit from being scaled up. Infrastructure makes the most sense here and once again having Infustructure publicly owned makes people more free as it prevents a private owner from restricting their movement on a whim. As far as what to cut we could do with half the military budget, half most fire department budgets and repurpose half of most police budgets into social works mental health, child care and education and infrastructure probably at the direction of the health department to get the most frugal use of funds.

The one where the guy wants to hold onto power purely for self serving and self preservation reasons and you know he will throw the entire country under the bus towards that end without a second thought.

The two major parties actually cooperated as early as the 1980s. Reagan's tax cut on the rich was a deal negotiated between the Democrats and the Republicans that both sides were happy with. Then Bill Clinton happened. Stuff came out while he was running for his first term that should have knocked him off the ballot, and it didn't. Then stuff happened while in office that should have made him resign, but he didn't. And then stuff happened that should have gotten him fired, but it didn't. And that's when the huge divide started. I actually heard two women talking in my optometrists office in 2016 about Trump, and one of the women said Who cares if Trump had an affair That's what men do. Look at Clinton. And the other woman said I guess you have a point. The issue right now is NOT with Trump, or Obama, or Bush II, or Clinton. The issue is with blind loyalty in the political parties. Both sides follow the President like he's a god and what he says is the gospel truth. The Democrats and Republicans are not political parties as much as they are cults now. And everyone is so scared of the other cult right now that they'll do whatever the cult tells them to do to make sure the other cult doesn't destroy America.

Real libertarians are economic libertarians because it is through economic liberty that we are really free. I don't mean that like economically free meaning free of starving or homelessness, i mean free as in you do what you want with what's yours, property rights and so forth and a free economy. Alot of people realize how important free speech is but they miss the fact that free speech is meaningless without private property. Nozick is an excellent libertarian philosopher. His argument about how free society and the unequal nature that they produce is really just a consequence of free choice. Social scientists busy thinking poor people are poor because they are poor and so you fix the problem by beating down the rich so nothing intimidates them, as well as transfering to them all the rich people's money, arw baffled when they consider the fact that if you organize a society as egalitarianly as possible, and then remove the tyranny that would be required to make society completely outcome equal, then the free choice of individuals will replacd that equal society with a hierarchy once again and that it is an outcome they desire. Ive read alot of other philosophers besides nozick, you might also read rand, locke and molyneux. I think jorden Peterson will become more libertarian as he develops his ideas further just because i think that hes got his finger on the pulse of why free speech is as important as it is, like he really knows the deep reasons and properth rights is just the naturally nessesary condition of free speech.

He's put more restrictions on guns than I can count, will never legalize anything that doesn't help him skim money off the top, and actively overreaches government power on a regular basis.

He wasn't fleeing he was reaching into his car, that means a totally different thing to a Cop in the USA when we have a 2nd amendment. I'm fully in support of the second amendment but that means our law enforcement has to take extra precautions or otherwise they end up dead. Jacob Blake didn't have a criminal history he had active Criminal activity i.e. a warrant for his arrest he was not there breaking up a fight he had a restraining order placed against him by his exgf and wasn't supposed to be there. The cops offered him due processed that's why they tried to arrest him and taser him but he just didn't care and walked off. If you're referring to the wendy's guy you shouldn't be messing with cops taser regardless if it's been discharged or not let alone aim it at another officer carrying a gun you can steal if you manage to incapacitate him.

Outside of a small incidence of unwarranted use of force most of the cases that have driven civic unrest really havent been unwarranted , the other issues you lost are systemic of over reach on the part of the legislative and judicial branches of government. Police dont make the laws. They just enforce the laws that are made. Its an unfortunate fact of reality that the power of the law always rests in the threat of the use of force if the law is broken. The problem is when law stands against the principles of liberty by seeking to control all aspects of public life or by directly violating inalienable rights. And, you really cant blame that on the police whose job it is to enforce that law.', \"Yes there are plenty of things not libertarian in modern policing but in general my point stands.

People can defend themselves if they maintain their right to be armed and they should be allowed to do so. But, if the only enforcement of the law is the hand of every individual, things would quickly deteriorate into chaos and you would not have any chance of getting due process. There should be public oversight of law enforcement but, in this age of misinformation and constant emotional pleas instead of fact and reason, unrestrained public oversight is a double edged sword.

You are establishing the word policepolicing as the term used for enforcement of government domination. You are setting up the terms security and peace keepers as being forced to protect the people from criminal activity. In this case, criminal meaning activity denying people of their basic rights to life, liberty, and property rather than just the violation of government regulation. I think your argument is a valid one. Your use of the term police is not exactly the way most people use the word. Most people use the term police to mean security and peace keeping forces local and state police and see the federal police as being something a bit different rarely just referring to Federal police as such. Personally, I think the biggest problem isnt really with the forced used to police but, with the law and the legislative and judicial branches of governments. In a free society, law should only exist to protect the peoples rights to life, liberty, and property. They should not be used as a regulatory tool to control every facet of personal life. The big problem with American law, as it has developed, is that the vast majority of laws are regulatory in nature and people are being arrested and prosecuted for violating regulations rather than committing actual crimes against person and property. As a good example, a person can often get a lot more jail time from violating drug regulations than raping a woman.', \"The police interacted with Jacob Blake specially to protect a woman who claimed Blake assaulted her.

Many are fleeing extreme poverty and violence and are searching for a free and safe place to try to build their lives. We respect and admire their courage and are proud that they see the United States as a place of freedom, stability, and prosperity. Of course, if someone has a record of violence, credible plans for violence, or acts violently, then Libertarians support blocking their entry, deporting, andor prosecuting and imprisoning them, depending on the offense. That's the party's stance on immigration which I can get behind.

You somehow need to come up with a convoluted view where property rights don't exist in the country in either private or collective form in order to support open borders. Nobody has the right to cross a border and transit illegally through private property that's quite a libertarian position. Similarly, any property ownedmanaged by a collective as should be the case with what are now public lands has the same rights under libertarian principles. Besides the sound ideology behind it, there is the practical aspect of this, which many of you ignore as if you're living in an ideal utopia. An open border in a libertarian utopia in your mind, because libertarianism doesn't promise utopia would result it a majority that would vote or revolt to destroy it. What, you think 100s of millions of people coming into the country would not be interested in removing property protections they won't be enjoying Or do you think that once they witness the glory of this utopia, they'll instantly adopt your ideology So let's set an example for you, and tell me where it deviates from libertarian principles. A group of individual land owners forms a collective voluntarily we'll call a town or county that sets rules on who may enter, access, or use the property they set aside for collective use. This collective has set parliamentary procedures to decide what criteria they set, and hire a police department to enforce these rules.

Those libertarians seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production, or else to restrict their purview or effects to usufruct property norms, in favor of common or cooperative ownership and management, viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty. Leftlibertarianism, also known as egalitarian libertarianism, leftwing libertarianism or social libertarianism, is a political philosophy and type of libertarianism that stresses both individual freedom and social equality. Leftlibertarianism represents several related yet distinct approaches to political and social theory. In its classical usage, it refers to antiauthoritarian varieties of leftwing politics such as anarchism, especially social anarchism, whose adherents simply call it libertarianism. In the United States, it represents the leftwing of the libertarian movement and the political positions associated with academic philosophers Hillel Steiner, Philippe Van Parijs and Peter Vallentyne that combine selfownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources. This is done to distinguish libertarian views on the nature of property and capital, usually along leftright or socialistcapitalist lines. While maintaining full respect for personal property, leftlibertarians are opposed to capitalism and the private ownership of the means of production. Other leftlibertarians are skeptical of, or fully against, private ownership of natural resources, arguing in contrast to rightlibertarians that neither claiming nor mixing ones labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and maintain that natural resources should be held in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively. Those leftlibertarians who support private property do so under different property norms and theories such as mutualism, or under the condition that recompense is offered to the local or even global community such as the SteinerVallentyne school. Marketoriented leftlibertarianism, including PierreJoseph Proudhons mutualism and Samuel Konkin IIIs agorism, appeals to leftwing concerns such as class, egalitarianism, environmentalism, gender, immigration and sexuality within the paradigm of freemarket anticapitalism. Although libertarianism in the United States has become associated to classical liberalism and minarchism, with rightlibertarianism being more known than leftlibertarianism, political usage of the term until then was associated exclusively with anticapitalism, libertarian socialism and social anarchism and in most parts of the world such an association still predominates.', 'deleted', 'Government police are not needed for that.

Jacob blake had an active warrant and was being arrested he resisted and made an action that must be construed as a threat to the officers life. I do think police officers have a right to defend themselves, obviously. I just don't think that reaching into your car gives a police officer the right to kill you. What is your alternative When the officer can't see your hands what are they supposed to do wait till the exact moment they are certain you have a gun That's ridiculous, this isn't the movies, that's how you get shot or killed, shit happens way too fast for that to work at all.

Others think that government should do more to solve our countrys problems. Which comes closer to your own view Some people think the government should promote traditional values in our society. Others think the government should not favor any particular set of values. Which comes closer to your own view Combining the responses to those two questions, Gallup found the ideological breakdown of the public shown below. With these two broad questions, Gallup consistently finds about 20 percent of respondents to be libertarian, and the number has been rising. They do not go ask every voter if they are libertarian. So basically if you say the government should stay out of business and values, they count you as libertarian. Which even on its face doesn't seem accurate. But then you see The Gallup Poll has a new estimate of the number of libertarians in the American electorate. In their 2015 Governance survey they find that 27 percent of respondents can be characterized as libertarians, the highest number it has ever found. The latest results also make libertarians the largest group in the electorate, as compared to 26 percent conservative, 23 percent liberal, and 15 percent populist. According to Gallup libertarians are the largest part of the electorate. In that sense they should win every election. One problem is defining libertarian. Libertarians can't even decide what a libertarian is. People say Rand Paul is a libertarian, but he's clearly a republican.

He then travelled on to Italy where he visited Florence and Naples and then settled in Rome where he remained for seven years. While in Rome, he sent his painting Cincinnatus current location unknown to the competition of the Academy of Ghent in 1802 where it won the golden prize.3 One of his works a Descent from the Cross St. Paul's Church, Antwerp in the Pantheon in Rome.1 He had been commissioned to paint the work as replacement for works by Rubens, which had been confiscated by the French occupiers.4 This work was so admired that he was immediately admitted as member and professor of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca in Rome.1 During his residence in Rome he painted many other commissions from Catholic institutions in Flanders and the Netherlands for religious works to replace paintings that had been lost to the French plunder.1 He returned to Flanders and lived and worked in Antwerp until 1815. That year he moved to The Hague, the administrative centre of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands of which the Southern Netherlands had become a part in 1815. Here he enjoyed the patronage of the royal court and was frequently commissioned to paint portraits of the royal family as well as other prominent sitters. He was admitted as a member of the Academy of Antwerp, the Academy of Amsterdam and correspondent of the Institut Nerlandais.1 He was appointed in 1820 to the professorship of drawing and director at the Acadmie des BeauxArts de Tournai Academy of Fine Arts, Tournai, positions he held until he resigned in 1827. He subsequently settled in Brussels, where he resided until his death except for a trip to England in 1836.1 He was the father of JeanMichel Cels, a landscape painter, and Josse Cels, an architect, who were trained by their father.2 Work Cornelis was a painter of religious subjects as well as portraits. He also produced a few genre paintings. His work was influenced by the NeoClassicist style becoming prevalent at the end of the 18th century. His masters Lens and Suve were both representatives of this style in Flanders.2 Portrait of Aryna van der Pot Portrait of Jessy Macpherson Swiss farm girl Portrait of the painter PierreFranois Jacobs fr References Adolphe Siret, Corneille Cels at the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 3, pp. 403405 in French Cornelis Cels at the Netherlands Institute for Art History in Dutch Livin Armand Marie De Bast, Annales du salon de Gand et de l'cole moderne des PaysBas Recueil de morceaux choisis parmi les ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, architecture et gravure, exposs au Muse en 1820, P.

Then we negotiate with the major parties for the incorporation of Libertarian policies. The party that most closely aligns with Libertarian values will get all pledged Libertarian votes as a block. The outcome would be publically debated and deliberated on and decided by a randomly selected, but statistically significant, portion of pledged voters via Sortition with input from a panel consisting of libertarian think tanks Cato, Mises, etc and the libertarian party.

He couldn't turn the United States government fascist in 4 years but he's done a damn good job of corrupting every institution in that direction. He's basically used Umberto Eco's 14 Points of Fascism as a roadmap. I mean, c'mon 1. The Cult of Tradition, characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by Tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement. 2. The Rejection of modernism, which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system. 3. The Cult of Action for Action's Sake, which dictates that action is of value in itself, and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with antiintellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science. 4. Disagreement Is Treason Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith. 5. Fear of Difference, which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants. 6. Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class, fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups. 7. Obsession with a Plot and the hypingup of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society such as the German elite's 'fear' of the 1930s Jewish populace's businesses and welldoings see also antiSemitism. Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession. 8. Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as at the same time too strong and too weak. On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will. 9. Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy because Life is Permanent Warfare there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war. 10. Contempt for the Weak, which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the ingroup. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate Leader who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force. 11. Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero, which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, the UrFascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death. 12. Machismo, which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality. 13. Selective Populism The People, conceived monolithically, have a Common Will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the Leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will though truly he dictates it. Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of no longer representing the Voice of the People. 14. Newspeak Fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning. Which box does Trump not check How about Jason Stanley's the Yale professor who literally wrote the book How Fascism Works characterization He defines fascism as a cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation. Trump is fascist by any reasonable modern day definition. Trying to argue he isn't because he isn't rounding up political enemies to kill yet is headinthesand naive. He's encouraging all kinds of violence, by police and by his supporters. He gleefully cheers on police violence as retribution. He defends vigilantes when they attack his political enemies. He's tried to employ the military. He's sent in DHS forces in unmarked to abduct people off the street. His AG is pressuring his prosecutors to charge protesters with sedition. He's encouraging his brownshirt supporters to violently engage with protesters in an almost eerie recreation of Hitler's brownshirts. Fascism is happening in America.\", \"Yep, unfortunately I don't see another way forward. This ideological purity and focus on the Presidency certainly isn't it.

Do not allow yourself to become complacent. If you yes, you, you personally, the human being sitting at your computer and reading these words, do not vote, then Trump will win, regardless of what the polls say. Say what you will about Republicans, but they always get out to vote. Even when it looks like they'll lose, even when they haven't researched the issues or the candidates, they get out and vote, every time. And that's how they win. Voting is the only way we can take this country back.

This is why the two party system sucks, etc., a million other stupid reasons she wasnt good enough. Be sure to keep repeating those total bullshit lies to yourselves over the next few decades, every time the old white guy who replaces Ginsburg, rules oppositely of how she would have and sets social progress back decades. Just remember to look on the bright side at least you didnt have to suffer through a Hillary Clinton presidency. Yes, it was your right to refuse to vote for her, either by voting 3rd party or not voting at all, but like all other freedoms, the right to vote does not mean freedom from social consequences. Its the right of people who voted for Hillary Clinton to forever blame and hate you for Trump getting elected and for every bad thing his presidency has caused.', 'Im shocked this isnt a bigger deal. Hundreds of thousands of Biden ballots might go uncounted due to mismatching signatures, mail delays, and other issues. That could EASILY tip the election.

I need to vent before election night to likeminded people make sure I'm not crazy. Not too sure this is allowed here, but here goes I am actually devastated that this thing is a serious toss up. It is fucking insane that people are seriously voting for Trump at all. He is an endlessly corrupt reality TV, trust fund moron. No morals, endless scandals and completely offputting behavior all around. He has exploited every gullible republican with identity politics as his weapon. No other president has ever deliberately divided us more. I am so embarrassed and full of rageshame that half of the country literally fell for his lies, deflections and repetitive rhetoric. It is heart breaking. How did this happen Are we that lacking in education How do we have such a severe critical thinking problem Why in the world are we so obsessed with this red team blue team bullshit Getting election jitters and would love to hear from y'all.

I am constantly attacked by the accepting left for being a minority that supports Trump and I want people here to know that lots of Muslims stand with you. There is a common misconception put out by Democrats that Trump is a xenophobic Muslim hater. Simply not true. I agree with him that we need to fight the radicals. You might not care but I'm posting this to let you guys know we're with you. I will say I'm not a hardcore Muslim in that I don't pray 5 times a day and I don't follow every rule word for word hijabs are pretty pointless imo, pretty ancient rule but I'd like you guys to know that we do not associate with the radicals.

Theres a lot of truth to what he says the cure shouldnt be worse than the virus itself I told my family and they were shook but in a way hes actually doing gods work without a lot of democrats realising it. Ive been democrat since 08 but it took until now to realise that the Democratic Party is not the party of Obama and substantial change anymore and its not been that way for a long time. As a computer scientist I think Andrew Yangs stance on big tech is the most pertinent issue to the election... and the fact is that Trump is the only person that can save us from the media and big tech now that theyve bought out the entire left seemingly.

I just thought that was funny. However I will vote for trump because clearly trump isnt racist. Biden is. Trump stands for the people. Biden presidency pushes towards more government power. And last trump hasnt been giving a fair chance. Racial tensions started since day 1 Trump was elected. We had Obama in office for 8 years and wonder why there are still racial tensions. I dont remember riots because we elected a black president. Everyone who was against Obama said well shit that sucks and went along with life. Republicans seem to have there head on straight.

Prosecutor Yarema seeks to investigate Hunter Biden Burisma for corruption. Joe Biden threatens to hold 1 billion aid to Ukraine if Yarema is not let go. Yarema is let go. Joe Biden then claims to have never interacted with Burisma ... but the emails show this is a lie Then the Biden campaign chooses not to denounce the emails whatsoever WTF So how is this not grift It's literally cashforinfluence, but apparently President Trump is the one that is compromised Am I living in loony land, how is this not massive news Where is the politics subreddit on this this at all ALSO I'm trying to find more information ... but Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Wikipedia and just about every single big media source are blocking the story for my safety. I had to visit Tim Pool's YT page and some Aussie Sky News site to see it. Huh Is this not blatant censorship Look, I'm no diehard supporter of any side. But for someone who is trying to find information and make an informed choice, this looks SO SHADY.

He picked her for only two reasons Gender and Race thats it. She is more radical than Bernie Sanders and the vast majority of Democrats didnt even vote for her because of her terribly run presidential campaigns, she had 3 in the polls didnt get any of the black vote and dropped out before the primary of her own home state which she is a senator for. She is extremely radical but I have no clue why Joe Biden thought this would gain him popularity or why this was a good idea, she insulted him and she was always against him during her campaign and now this all magically goes away. She was a terrible choice for VP and I dont know why even thought I like Joe Biden that it would be a good idea to vote for this terrible VP choice by him.', \"Last debate I posted about how terribly Trump was doing and how he needed to let Biden talk and focus on the issues. This time Trump is doing it and so much more. This is the best and most Presidential I've ever seen him. He is sticking to the issues, addressing the points directly, and being articulate and authentic while throwing some incisive shade at Biden where it's called for. He's destroying Biden who's dodging every question with typical platitudes and transparent political bullshit, on which Trump called him out DIRECTLY.

Doesn't shut up Biden during his interruptions. This is a complete shit show.\", 'As far as I am concerned this is revenge and some sweet sweet Karma. I am very happy Republicans are actually going through with this and not backing down like they normally would. Trump has taught them well that you dont need to kiss the Democrat state run medias ass to win elections. Also why isnt any of the Republicans actually saying this fact outloud We all know its because Democrats impeached Trump because they have been hunting the witch for 4 years and have come up empty each time. Why do Republicans keep trying to come up with some bull shit excuse They dont need to explain themselves to a partisan media. Just do it and say what were all thinking its because Democrats Impeached Trump during a election season.

I had decided I wasn't voting for Trump earlier this year after I saw his handling of COVID being unacceptably incompetent, but hearing his own words that he lied to me and to everyone else about COVID pushed me over the line. Also even though there's not proof, I know in my heart that what's he allegedly said about the troops is true. I don't really like Biden, or his policies, but Trump must be stopped. I'm voting for Biden, also I live in Pennsylvania, for what that's worth. You can look through my post history if you want, I made this account to troll Hillary in 2016, and looking back at some of my comments I can't believe how vile and frankly stupid I was.\", 'It was the last call of the day. The phone bank was intended only for reaching out to Biden voters, to help them register and request their ballots. I asked this voter the usual questions and he said he was both registered and had requested his ballot. Finally, I asked him if he was supporting Joe Biden. He paused and said he was unsure. Going off script, I asked him if there was any questions I could answer about Joe. He was a supporter of Bernie Sanders in the primary. I replied that I was as well. He asked me what positions Biden had taken that are the same as Bernie. I quickly pointed out that he supports 15hr minimum wage like Bernie had pushed for since 2016. He also favors of lowering the age of Medicare to 60, which is a step in Bernies goal of setting the age to 0. Biden wants a public option, also a step towards single payer. I also noted that Biden has always been ideologically flexible. His voting record in the Senate was always in the exact middle of the party. A majority of Democratic primary voters supported single payer. Biden tries to move with the center of mass of the party. Biden is an excellent lower case democrat in that sense. Finally, he asked about Bidens plans for students. I actually didnt know either so I looked it up with him on the phone. We were both impressed to learn his plan is very progressive He wants free public colleges and student loan forgiveness after 20 years. The conversion ended with him telling me he was changing his vote from Trump to Biden I felt elated to have flipped a Trump voter. There are still open minded persuadable voters out there. Dont be afraid to go off script and try convincing voters with the facts.

Im totally on board with that I think both political parties right now have policies that are a serious threat to individual liberties. On top of that, I think Trump as a human in general is not a great guy. However, to my knowledge this subreddit is supposed to be different than the rest of reddit, which is a total a political echo chamber. Its frustrating to come to a place where there is supposed to be real political discussion, especially of libertarian ideals, and instead, be greeted by a top post on hot at the time of writing that has NOTHING to do with libertarian philosophy or even politics in general When I come to I dont care that Trump said he had the biggest tower in Manhattan after 911. Awful thing to say. But it doesnt belong here I can read that and a variety of other Trump Bad posts by going to What does Trump saying that have to do with libertarianism I feel like leading up to the election this sub has gradually decreased in quality and is slowly turning into the rest of Reddit, an obsession with Donald Trump.

Its not splitting the vote. Its not enabling the other side. Its not throwing my vote away. Its only splitting the vote because you uninformed and nave fuckstick cant imagine voting 3rd party let alone informing yourself on more than 2 options every election cycle.

This is not a refugee camp for disillusioned Republicans or Democrats. We are our own party with our own platform and we've been here for many many years.\", \"In the 2020 New Zealand election held on 17 October, the libertarian and classical liberal party, ACT Association of Consumers and Taxpayers, achieved a record high 8 of the total vote. This results in 8 of the seats in Parliament House of Representatives being held by ACT. Prior to the election, ACT held 0.5 of the vote and just one seat out of the 120 total seats. During the last parliamentary term, bills would be passed 1191, with the single ACT member of parliament the only voice opposing laws severely restricting freedom. The major conservative opposition party, National, collapsed in a year where there were 3 different leaders, including one who kept a Trump MAGA hat displayed prominently in his office. As a member of ACT, I'm proud of what we achieved this election, and the new reinforcements will be key voices to hold prime minister Ardern's Labour government to account. There is huge momentum for libertarianism here, and I sincerely wish libertarians in other countries hold on to hope, because there are many of us fighting to preserve freedoms and choice.\", \"If you support Trump, you arent libertarian Im serious. So Ive seen 'libertarians' on YouTube, reddit, and twitter say that they will be voting for Trump and that Trump is more libertarian than the libertarian party. Now I understand the criticisms of the LP and a lot of them are valid. But to say that Trump is libertarian is laughable. So Im going to go over Trumps term and point to policies which he pushed which are anti liberty and anti libertarian. 1. The National Debt Donald Trump is the worst president in history when it comes to the national debt. In 4 years, he added more to the national debt then Obama did in 8 and Bush did 8. Trump increased the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. 2. The Second Amendment Trump is anti second amendment, and so is the Republican Party. Trump passed the first gun control in decades which banned bump stocks. Trump hates the second amendment. 3. The Patriot ActNSA Spying Trump claims he hates unwarranted surveillance yet he expanded the patriot act and extended it. Trump expanded it and can now spy on us since 2018. 4. Trumps drone strikes Obama is known as the 'bomber in chief' which is true. But Trump has actually surpassed Obama in drone strikes and actually is the biggest drone striker in history. 5. Trump didnt end the wars Trump didnt end the wars and has actually expanded them in different countries and added troops there. 6. Hates Free Market capitalism Trump doesnt support capitalism and instead supports corporatism. He supported massive bailouts of corporations which increased the debt and kept failing companies afloat. Hes a corporatist who supported the cares act, the biggest transfer of wealth in history. Trump is a fraud and libertarians should hate him as much as Biden.\", 'I thought it was entertaining.

So now voters voting for Trump are not voting on hope, but voting that they want more of his steaming pile of shit. It makes me feel like we are all lesser people for this.

The only way for the Republican Party to stay in power is to convince people they actually care about them and when that doesnt work they either convince people not to care at all aka dont show up to vote, intimidate people at the polls, and then try and throw out ballots. I dont believe that Trump even has the favor of half the country, its just Trumpists are the loudest and Republican loyalists are being complicit. At this point, the people who are still voting for Trump have put Trump on a god tier and theres nothing he can do wrong. His campaign left people in the cold Not his fault. Additionally, Id like to point out the information seeking behaviors that Ive noticed of loud Trump supporter in my Facebook feed. They tend to only believe Fox News. Personally, I dont watch the news on TV anymore but I do sometimes keep their articles in my thread just to see how different sources are covering it. Its been uncovered already that Fox News is propaganda. I notice that when they decide which parts to cover. Most headlines are talking about how Trump is trailing in the polls and Fox News chooses to say this black man supports Trump or something of the like. Fox News has been a key player in setting up this divisive stance. Theres a youre either with us or against us belief that theyve manifested, but its turned into more than that. Trump has made it all about him. If youre a real American, you support him. If you dont, then fuck you and get out. His supporters have adopted this rhetoric as well. Supporting Trump means youre a Godfearing Christian and you love your country. Being a liberal means you want to take our guns, turn everyone gay, kill all the babies, and make us communists. Another reason in which Trump still has supports is the way people view reality. Theres an article from the Atlantic that describes their reality as climbing the hill of the American dream. Ill link it here article I dont want to pinpoint a lack of education as a player. Because thats just a consequence of the underlying systemic issues. The USs infrastructure was built on oppression by race, wealth, and status. It picks and chooses whos on top and keeps people down on the bottom. Our capitalist state relies on sacrifice zones and wasted lives in order to thrive. We profit on prisons and coal mining towns. We repeatedly decide how much a life is worth.

He would have heard of them had he attended intelligence briefings, but he prefers golfing and justifies it by saying I'm very smart which is narcissistic and irrational being smart doesn't make you know everything. You could argue that he misspoke, and admittedly later he condemned them by telling them to stand down. The problem is that statement did not have the coverage he could have during the debate. The White House was also unable to make an official statement. That is what everyone is criticizing. His stance on white supremacists is not official, when it should absolutely be. My take is he doesn't want to lose the votes from white supremacists, thus he cannot condemn them. Even Fox news is tired of it. That is what people are mad about.

The US is actively bombing 8 countries. Can you name them all Under Obama our drones had 90 civillian casualties, according to our own militaries internal reporting. They gave a war criminal the nobel peace prize, incredible. In Syria, after the US convinced Gaddafi to get rid of nuclear armament and then subsequently killed him, there are now openair slave markets in a completely failed state. Trump has not gotten us into a new war, but Iran is understandably concerned that we stopped giving them their money in the Iran deal, and will drop their end of the bargain out of fear of ending up like Gaddafi. It doesn't really help tensions that we just assassinated their top general, lol. A bad guy, but he was also most well known in the region for fighting Isis. This is beyond a partisan problem. It is not in either parties interests to spend so much on the military industrial complex, but every politician finds a way to justify it, with Bush and Obama being the most egregious.

Prosecutor Yarema seeks to investigate Hunter Biden Burisma for corruption. No. Yarema was NOT investigating. He was fired for NOT investigating. The new leaders in Ukraine wanted to clamp down on the corruption that was rampant in the previous administration, and Yarema was not doing that. So he was fired. Joe Biden threatens to hold 1 billion aid to Ukraine if Yarema is not let go. No. The Obama administration quickly made friends with the new Ukrainian administration for reasons I haven't looked into and won't try to explain, and was in favor of the firing of Yarema because he wasn't doing his job. Joe Biden couldn't withhold aid to stop an investigation, because no investigation was taking place. Joe Biden then claims to have never interacted with Burisma ... but the emails show this is a lie The emails suggest that Hunter Biden was allegedly, whatever open to setting up a meeting with Joe. They don't say whether or not a meeting was actually set up or actually took place. Am I living in loony land, how is this not massive news Two reasons. 1 The sourcing for the article is extremely questionable. The FBI just announced they're investigating Giuliani and the sourcing of the emails because they think this was allegedly, whatever a Russian intelligence operation. In other words, Russian intelligence hackedstolewhatever these emails, and turned them over to Giuliani, who then gave them to the press. The story that Hunter Biden gave his computers to a repairman, who then turned them over to Giuliani is... um... pretty obviously bullshit. 2 The content of the emails isn't actually that bad. They don't say anything about an actual meeting taking place. They also don't say anything about a meeting not taking place, but we can reasonably assume that there's no email that shows a meeting took place, because Giuliani would obviously leak that. Now, had a meeting taken place, would that be bad for Joe Biden Yeah, that looks bad. But is at an OMG MASSIVE SCANDAL that sinks Joe Biden No. Not even close. Trump has been engaged in all kinds of garden variety corruption for the last 4 years most voters don't care at this point, because there's more important things going on. There's an article every week about Trump profiting in one way or another from being President that echoes around the liberal bubble for a few days and then disappears Secret service spends 80,000 of tax payer money on golf carts at Trump Resort, blah blah blah. People don't care. They want a job and healthcare the rest is just noise. I had to visit Tim Pool's YT page and some Aussie Sky News site to see it. Huh Is this not blatant censorship Yes, it's censorship. Twitter, Facebook, etc are private platforms. They're not bound by the same first amendment laws as the government i. they can censor what they want. For example, terrorist propaganda is posted to these sites all the time and quickly deleted. I'm NOT comparing this story to terrorist propaganda, merely pointing out that censorship happens all the time on social media.\", \"You're all fucking morons.\", 'You neglect to mention that the entire free world wanted Prosecutor Yarema fired... particularly, because he failed to investigate corruption at Burisma... knowing this fact, the rest of your argument turns to bullshit.. You can research yourself that one of the main reasons for everyone, not just Biden, wanting Yarema fired was because he failed to look into corruption at Barisma... But Im sure its much more fulfilling to ignore that fact as it doesnt fit into your predetermined outlook...', \"Sorry OP but you have no understanding of this. Yes Hunter used his family name to get an rasy and high paying job. This is BS but if you are considered about it, you should look at Trump who's nepotism is off the charts. Now whats wrong Yarema had made no public statements about thinking about investigating Burisma. In fact this only came out AFTER he was fired. He infact was extremely corrupt himself and wouldn't investigate any companies while he was in his position. This is why Biden did what he did. He did what he did at the direction of Obama, our EU allies, AND REPUBLICAN SENATORS. So please tell me if every one of those people that directed Biden also had children working at that company who was not under any public investigation at the time. This is a known Russian smear campiagn that Russian agents fed this BS to Rudy Giuliani look at the new headlines about him. Rudy thinking that he had a hot lead built a team many of whom are now arrested for illegally funneling money into donations to try to get information about it. To assist Rudy, Trump dismantled the normal Diplomatic channels that would have stopped Rudy and pressured the Ukraine President to work with his personal lawyer to investigate his political rival. This is unheard of and criminal. Now what do these latest emails show that only conservatives care about It shows that Hunter Introduced his business partner to his father. Thats about it.

It was to protect the company at a time when it was facing investigations, said Onyshchenko, who left the country in 2016. The Ministry of Internal Affairs removed Zlochevskyi from its wanted list. The General Prosecutors Office initially investigated Zlochevskyis alleged illicit enrichment, but shifted its investigation to that of a more minor offense, tax evasion, and eventually closed the case in 2016. The criminal case was closed exactly 1 week before Trump was elected ie, when Biden was no longer responsible for Ukraine foreign policy. A corrupt businessman doesn't appoint powerful political figures to a board, and pay them generously, because they're kindhearted. They serve a purpose, and it's not just for advice. If that were the case, they could instead hire experts, with decades of education and experience. No one in the Prosecutor Generals Office has been punished for the dumping of Zlochevskyis case.

Additionally, the federal stockpile was distributed unevenly, favoring states like Florida who received 100 of their requests, unlike Massachusetts and Maine who only received 17 and 5 respectively.

Trump never EVER implicated it should be taken seriously which in turn made his less than average intelligence supporters, think it wasnt serious. If he would have encouraged the use of masks been a real leader and set guidelines for all states to follow, maybe not been a narcissist and stepped aside to let the experts talk, we would have a unified front. No one is saying there probably wouldnt have been people who died. And I agree that the numbers from China and Russia could be inaccurate. But there are plenty of other reputable countries that are high income countries like us, where the US has extremely higher death rates from covid and just general death causes. Implying he knew more than scientists who study diseases and epidemics for a living, denouncing anything they said, specifically asked if people could drink disinfectant, spreading misinformation is deadly and he is the cause. And before the whole Fauci said no masks comes up, if you look at the whole picture, it was because the US didn't have enough PPE at the time, so Fauci was asking the public to save the actual medical masks and n95 masks for hospital workers. Lastly, one measly stimulus check did nothing in the long term. You guys are the laziest mofos, there is mountains of evidence showing how inadequately he handled this virus and you call on people who dont support him to show you the evidence that you will only say is fake news. The travel ban from china just meant people flew to places like italy first before coming back, it made it harder to do contact tracing and harder to track and meant more spreading of the virus. As someone who has lived with a chronic illness that meant I wore oxygen by age 22, a mask is literally the least amount you can do. Be grateful for your health I will die before my husband, before my friends and before you say anything, I had a lung transplant almost 7 years ago, and I have been working full time since 7 months after my transplant. I am a productive member of society.\", 'Doesnt matter. You jumped in to my response. Please answer the questions. I never once asked for sources. I asked for evidence that any of what he lied was true. He responded with links to articles that he didnt read. Thats neither argument nor evidence. As we all know, starting a response with lol is indeed a huge tell for cognitive dissonance. Youre also clearly experiencing it right now. Its obvious from your straw man arguments.', 'This happened.', 'Thats....not an explanation. Its two words. Be specific.', 'So first off show me where all these countries are doing so much better than we are And lets look at deaths per million not the overall count because we have a MUCH higher population count than these other countries so obviously the overall number would be more. Also while were at it, lets look at the numbers for people who died FROM COVID vs the reporting of those who simply died WITH COVID. HUGE differences in numbers there. And while the disinfectant comment wasnt helpful, it also wasnt as bad as the media made it out to be. I watched the press conference at the time and it was blown way out of proportion. If you think the travel bans didnt do any good, it would have been way worse if they werent enacted. Most people dont have the money to fly half way around the world to try and get past a travel ban so thats a lame argument. So if you have all these mountains of evidence show me something thats concrete where Trump endangered the population of the US. Fauci has stated numerous times in numerous interviews that Trump didnt say anything any differently than he was told from the experts at the time.', 'So provide all this evidence.', 'Haha your life must be very fun Well, since you dont consider articlessources evidence, what exactly do you consider evidence Just so you cant keep moving the goal posts here.

Doesnt surprise me that youre covering your ears because someone contradicted your claim.', 'Contact tracing clearly shows that his rallies have spread covid. You seriously needed that spelled out for you', \"There is your evidence, and that includes overall deaths not just what was noted as covid and it's also accounts for population bro. We won't change each others minds because dying with covid and from covid are the same thing and if you can't understand the idea that someone who has other health factors and gets covid and then dies due to covid exacerbating their previous conditions still means it's a covid death because without ever contracting covid, they would still be alive, then that's on your lack of being able to understand basic cause and effect. I have cystic fibrosis and I have had a double lung transplant. So if I get covid and die, due to covid creating a secondary bacterial infection in my lungs which then triggers my immune response to recognize the lungs arent in fact mine, triggering rejection of my lungs, I still die from covid and rejection... do you get it study done by scientists\", \"It is, thanks. Evidence would be an actual articulated explanation of what happened. Sources are fine if they're used as references. No movement of goalposts whatsoever. That's the thing.

Also Im not a moron and know that people can die of complications from having COVID. However there have been dozens of reports that have come out where people have been counted in the COVID death number simply for testing positive for COVID at the time of death, but NOT dying from anything related to it. Such as someone dying from a heart attack with no COVID symptoms. Or a car accident or suicide and they tested positive for COVID during the autopsy. And this has been done so the hospitals can get more money from the feds for the COVID deaths. Im sorry you have the medical issues you have and wish you well, but your facts are skewed.', 'Sorry again, not sure how to phrase it better, too late.', \"Here you go, since somehow it's not obvious to you.\", \"Valid, the source you provided was interesting and more up to date, thanks for link. And gives me more reason to research and potentially change my opinion. I will argue the whole hospitals get more money thing seems fishy, I haven't seen any sources or reputable links to vouch for that, only heresay, and honestly seems like another conspiracy theory. That said, I find it hard to believe only because having medical issues means I talk to a lot of hospital workers, I can't imagine a hospital worker doing that to give their boss more money when they are already being shafted by their employers, and not particularly happy with hospital administration, if that makes sense. Also my mother died unexpectedly this year, its super expensive to get an autopsy done when there is no suspicion of foul play, so again highly doubt there are a bunch autopsies being done to try to give someone a covid death. And so you know, my mother had no covid on her death certificate. Lastly, dozens of reports over our whole country won't be adding a lot to the covid death count. Its not like that would account for 100,000 deaths, maybe a few hundred max. But again, highly doubt it. I would like to see overall deaths for all countries regardless of cause just to see the true toll of covid this year for everyone, not just US.\", \"What does it say I don't open blind links.\", \"You should read the article yourself.

However its possible that its been slightly misrepresented Source Also I misspoke when I said autopsies rather than simply a cause of death being reported on the death certificate. The bottom line is that it was expected that if we did nothing we would have over 2 million deaths to COVID and the best case scenario was closer to 200k. I tried to find where I had seen those numbers but was unable to do so. However I did find this from the BBC that shows how the US has actually done pretty well compared to the rest of the world. Source Those trying to say Trump has totally failed the US in how this has been handled is truly incorrect when you look at the statistics. Obviously as Trump has said MANY times, one death is too many but considering we are dealing with a situation that has never been dealt with in modern times, hes done much better than anyone on the left will ever give him credit for', \"You literally just asked for posted evidence and I gave it to you.

But not everything. Things like Bidens family involvement in Ukraine and other countries for personal gain is out there. The main thing is that when politicians get rich from being in government is where you cant trust them. Trump was rich before he got into politics which is a big plus. That is why Joe and the other gang cannot be trusted. Past performance speaks loud and clear. The past 4 years revealed so much about the media. Nothing can be trusted anymore what the media says. So whenever theres something negative coming out about Trump, you know its most likely a lie. Yes, the environment is important, but again Joe and the dems are not the right people for it. Not saying Trump is also, but he is a million times better on the rest of the more important things on the plate going on right now.

Ted Cruz RTexas It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you dont do this in an election year. 2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham RS.C. If an opening comes in the last year of President Trumps term, and the primary process has started, well wait to the next election. 2016, Sen. Marco Rubio RFla. I dont think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this presidents term I would say that if it was a Republican president. 2016, Sen. David Perdue RGa. The very balance of our nations highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people. 2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley RIowa A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldnt be denied a voice. 2016, Sen. Thom Tillis RN.C. The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president. 2016, Sen. Richard Burr RN.C. In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president. 2016, Sen. Roy Blunt RMo. The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president. 2016, Sen. Cory Gardner RCol. I think were too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision. 2016, Sen. Rob Portman ROhio I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldnt be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and its been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year. 2016, Sen. Ron Johnson RWisc. I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.

President is usually an easy decision for me. The hardest was probably Romney but that was less about Obama and more about the gridlock and increasing polarization.

They are very deep in it despite being antitrump in 2016 only starting post these crazy conspiracy theories recently this year. They believe every democrat is evil and many things I refuse to say out loud because it's simply ignorant and wrong. They also believe aliens run the government and only dear leader Trump can save America despite reality being to the contrary. They ignore protocol for COVID19 social distancing and even have massive parties where they don't wear masks because thats what Trump does at his rallies.

We know he said awful, immature, and disparaging things about McCain and a goldstar family in the past. This all makes the accusations that he insulted our soldiers very believable. Also, Trump's attempt to unilaterally ban Tik Tok and other phone apps really bothers me. I don't care about Tik Tok itself, but the idea that he could just sign a piece of paper and tell all of us which programs we can and can't use on our own private property is just not acceptable. Every individual should be free to make the choice to risk their own personal data if they want to. If Trump feels that it is a matter of national security, he can just order it banned on government worker's phones, and mind is own business in regards to what private citizens do with their own private property. Then there is also his open embrace of ridiculous conspiracy theories knowingly pushing lies onto the American people to serve his own political interests with complete disregard to the damage it is doing to society. He also regularly retweets posts from known white supremacists and open racists. He even literally tweeted a video of one of his supporters shouting 'white power'. I think that anybody who supports Trump at this point either agrees with these awful things, or they are just lying to themselves about him.

I'm no economist, but in general taxing corporations from what I've heard is not always the best in every circumstance, but one argument that makes a lot of sense for me is this Companies like Amazon do a lot of good they make things easier to buy and provide good service. Also make things easier to sell. And they provide a lot of jobs. Democrats don't want to stop that by any means. But they do want to make sure that those jobs are decent paying and the workers have good working conditions. This is where unions come in as one solution instead of the govt deciding the exact conditions, let the workers decide what's most important to them. They also want to make sure that those companies are paying their share for the public good that help them deliver things. So when an Amazon warehouse opens up in a city, there will be a lot more demand for roads and bridges, which costs money. Since Amazon is profiting from these public goods, the taxpayers should not be the only ones paying to build and maintain these roads and bridges. Amazon should pay. Or maybe the CEO pays a lot in taxes to help fund schools, preK, and healthcare subsidies for people in the community. Basically the economics come out to this our system heavily rewards those at the top of the economy. That's fine, they have to work hard and are very hard to replace. But Democrats in general think we should structure the system to reward them a little less they'll still have a huge amount of money, in order to make sure the huge number of people in the middle and bottom have good quality lives.

That is why it's so bad that you have just two parties. There is almost no battlefield of ideas and just a team you are a part of. Let's have a quick rundown. I think the ban of abortions is goverment overreach. I personally wouldnt like to have one for a partner or smth, but I don't think the government has a say in this decision. Gun control certainly works, but it's also a question about freedom. Lots of liberals think that people should be able to own guns, but that certain regulations make the country safer for everyone. Criminals or people with mental problems also shouldn't have them. The Iraq war was truly stupid and so is every single war in the middle east. Movies where Soldiers fight occupation forces are watched by millions, but people don't see how this applies in the real world to the middle east.

I'm also not sure how you could integrate RCV into the delegate system.\", 'The support was from the millions of voters who wanted someone electable to beat Donald Trump. They were afraid Bernie would lose which I still disagree with. I voted for Bernie Sanders twice but the majority of Democratic voters chose otherwise. Living in a democracy means not always getting what you want. It was a free and fair election. It wasnt perfect but no election ever is. The machinations of party elites only mattered because voters chose to listen to them. In the end, the voters decided overwhelmingly for Biden. And keep in mind that DNC elections have proportional representation of delegates, which is much better than a winnertakeall system. Bernie parlayed that delegate count into forcing progressive changes to Bidens platform and the rules of the DNC. Bernie won POC voters under 45, the future is with his set of ideas.

The reason I don't is that I just don't trust the next Republican president to administer it. I don't want to give the next Trump the opportunity to instantly defund all trans and reproductive healthcare with the stroke of a pen. I don't think it's a good idea to create a single point of failure, knowing that it's eventually going to fall into the hands of someone who literally wants many marginalized groups to die. And I know that the plan would be to make that sort of thing illegal, but the last four years have demonstrated how little the law matters to an administration that just chooses not to care. I would strongly support a Medicaid for All system, one that positioned the states as a buffer which would be similar to the Canadian model that I know works well. But that unfortunately wasn't on the menu.

The seven states that don't allow requested recounts are Florida, South Carolina, Connecticut, Hawaii, Mississippi, Arizona and Tennessee. You may be thinking Hey, that's more than 50 states. Some states have a blended system if the first count is within the specified percentage, it occurs with no charge to any campaign, but if it's not that close, the requesting campaign must bear the costs. There are a few quirks California only has requested recounts which for statewide races are obviously hella expensive and the requesting party is charged UNLESS the recount changes the winner of the election. Kansas and a few other states only trigger automatic recounts if there is some proof of irregularity in the election. Tennessee only allows a recount as a possible remedy in a formally contested election, which can be based on a tie vote, a credible showing of election fraud or machine malfunction, or when a court orders it.

At the moment, more hardline libertarians and ancaps tend to think this is the democrats, on account of their hard swing to the authoritarian left since the Obama administration.

I had just finished college and was making my way to New York to begin my new engineering job. Slowly my paranoia and fear that people were out to get me overtook me and in a panic, I drove to an airport and rushed to the nearest security officer. From there I was put in an ambulance and taken to a hospital where I received my diagnosis of schizophrenia. Once released from the hospital, I rushed to my new career and disregarded my new diagnosis. My diagnosis was just a fluke, I told myself. Two years later, back at home in Indiana, the symptoms returned. This time worse than the first time. I was sent to an inpatient psychiatric hospital and had my schizophrenia diagnosis confirmed. It was here that I was fortunate enough to learn about first episode psychosis FEP clinics. Even though this was technically my second psychotic event, it was only two years since my first psychotic episode. Therefore, fortunately, I was accepted to the FEP clinic in Indianapolis named PARC Prevention and Recovery Center for early psychosis. In order to focus on my health and be close to family and friends, I resigned from my job in New York to stay in Indiana and get help at PARC. This was the beginning of my road to recovery. I started all the main aspects of coordinated specialty care CSC that a FEP clinic offers cognitive behavioral therapy, low dose antipsychotic medication a long acting injectable, case management, continued employment in the form of a new engineering job close to home, and family and peer support. In addition, I participated in research at the FEP clinic to help further the understanding of the disease. I also joined my local NAMI and MHA support groups. After my second psychotic episode, I made the choice to not only get better but be a better person these support structures were there to assist me in that goal. During the last 15 months I have been receiving care at PARC, I believe I have gotten much better. My psychotic symptoms such as paranoia and delusions have gone away. I have grown closer to my family with the help of therapy and an excellent therapist. My existing friendships have also been strengthened, and I have made new friends through my support groups. My antipsychotic dosage has been lowered and may be reduced again in the future. In addition, my therapy appointments have been reduced from four times a month to two. In the next few years, I would like to reduce therapy as I have discovered my own healthy coping habits to overcome any difficulties I may encounter. As with therapy, my psychiatrist appointments will also be reduced from once a month to once every two or three months. I plan to continue going to my local support groups because they are close to home and help me to feel less alone and part of a community. Eventually I plan to move into my own place and once again be completely selfsufficient. With the help of my FEP clinic team, community, family, and friends, I have gotten back on track.

I just don't see how a free market is going to work in health insurance when the entire point is to pool risk to decrease individual cost which will naturally drift towards monopoly with a free market system. Now I don't think we need to completely nationalize. I think private practice can be a good thing and market forces can work at that level because patients have a real choice and can choose the practitioner they go to. I think we need a blended system using market forces for enterprises that can have positive market forces working on them and to nationalize things that tend to monopolize and benefit from being scaled up. Infrastructure makes the most sense here and once again having Infustructure publicly owned makes people more free as it prevents a private owner from restricting their movement on a whim. As far as what to cut we could do with half the military budget, half most fire department budgets and repurpose half of most police budgets into social works mental health, child care and education and infrastructure probably at the direction of the health department to get the most frugal use of funds.

Notably, that lack of coordination meant that while the CDC initially botched its tests, the FDA was slow to grant state and private labs the authority to produce their own tests. This then delayed the deploying of mass testing, which had a domino effect on contact tracing and carrying out quarantinesisolation.

But there's a kind of authoritarianism that is far worse and far more dangerous than either of these two that which is focused purely on personal gain the kind that the current President is practicing. The one where the guy wants to hold onto power purely for self serving and self preservation reasons and you know he will throw the entire country under the bus towards that end without a second thought. Regardless of your stripe every citizen should be fighting tooth and nail against it. So it's not only natural to see more discussion about it but it's also very much warranted and very much needed.

But I believe that leaving him in office is just retaliation for the Democrats leaving Bill Clinton in office. These two parties play a political game back and forth. The two major parties actually cooperated as early as the 1980s. Reagan's tax cut on the rich was a deal negotiated between the Democrats and the Republicans that both sides were happy with. Then Bill Clinton happened. Stuff came out while he was running for his first term that should have knocked him off the ballot, and it didn't. Then stuff happened while in office that should have made him resign, but he didn't. And then stuff happened that should have gotten him fired, but it didn't. And that's when the huge divide started. I actually heard two women talking in my optometrists office in 2016 about Trump, and one of the women said Who cares if Trump had an affair That's what men do. Look at Clinton. And the other woman said I guess you have a point. The issue right now is NOT with Trump, or Obama, or Bush II, or Clinton. The issue is with blind loyalty in the political parties. Both sides follow the President like he's a god and what he says is the gospel truth. The Democrats and Republicans are not political parties as much as they are cults now. And everyone is so scared of the other cult right now that they'll do whatever the cult tells them to do to make sure the other cult doesn't destroy America.

Real libertarians are economic libertarians because it is through economic liberty that we are really free. I don't mean that like economically free meaning free of starving or homelessness, i mean free as in you do what you want with what's yours, property rights and so forth and a free economy. Alot of people realize how important free speech is but they miss the fact that free speech is meaningless without private property. Nozick is an excellent libertarian philosopher. His argument about how free society and the unequal nature that they produce is really just a consequence of free choice. Social scientists busy thinking poor people are poor because they are poor and so you fix the problem by beating down the rich so nothing intimidates them, as well as transfering to them all the rich people's money, arw baffled when they consider the fact that if you organize a society as egalitarianly as possible, and then remove the tyranny that would be required to make society completely outcome equal, then the free choice of individuals will replacd that equal society with a hierarchy once again and that it is an outcome they desire. Ive read alot of other philosophers besides nozick, you might also read rand, locke and molyneux. I think jorden Peterson will become more libertarian as he develops his ideas further just because i think that hes got his finger on the pulse of why free speech is as important as it is, like he really knows the deep reasons and properth rights is just the naturally nessesary condition of free speech.

No one wants to hear anyone jack themselves and Trump off to how great the response to covid was for three weeks back in March if Trump subverted all the good it did by denying the virus's legitimacy right after. Any accomplishment he's performed between then and now is completely washed out the door in wake of the nearing 200,000 bodies he's accumulated. It's not like he's ever been a Libertarian anyways. He's put more restrictions on guns than I can count, will never legalize anything that doesn't help him skim money off the top, and actively overreaches government power on a regular basis.

The big problem with American law, as it has developed, is that the vast majority of laws are regulatory in nature and people are being arrested and prosecuted for violating regulations rather than committing actual crimes against person and property. As a good example, a person can often get a lot more jail time from violating drug regulations than raping a woman.', \"The police interacted with Jacob Blake specially to protect a woman who claimed Blake assaulted her. This is the bulk of what police do protect citizens from bad actors. It is simply nonsense to state that communities don't need policing to protect peaceful citizens from predators.\", \"The other side would probably argue that the poor should pay for the police services to protect wealthy property because they wouldn't need the protection if it weren't for the poor.\", \"That goes to my point about the person I replied to saying bash police to find conservatives pretending to be libertarian. I just didn't go in depth like you.\", \"The current Libertarian platform isn't open borders. People just like to throw that as an argument about how dumb libertarians are. But in general libertarianism is a lot more open about immigration than conservatives. Whether they are from India or Mexico, whether they have advanced degrees or very little education, immigrants have one great thing in common they bravely left their familiar surroundings in search of a better life. Many are fleeing extreme poverty and violence and are searching for a free and safe place to try to build their lives. We respect and admire their courage and are proud that they see the United States as a place of freedom, stability, and prosperity. Of course, if someone has a record of violence, credible plans for violence, or acts violently, then Libertarians support blocking their entry, deporting, andor prosecuting and imprisoning them, depending on the offense. That's the party's stance on immigration which I can get behind. Its not entirely open borders there would still be border controls and an immigration system.\", \"A controlled immigration programme it doesn't restrict the Liberty of your population or restrict freedom of movement at all. People can still come and visit and enjoy the country. I dont think saying 'you have to apply and join us legally' is anti liberty. theres evidence of repressive cultures that are anti liberty all over the world I dont think you have to invent anything. controlled borders actually protects the liberty of your population.\", 'So my next door neighbor should just be able to walk into my house The problem with completely open borders is that its just not feasible. For example, Certainly we need some safety nets, so then who pays taxes for what and how much', \"Freedom of movement within our borders sure we can't provide the same to the world, especially when we have vast wealth and there are people here trying to leverage the government to give that wealth away.\", 'If you have open borders and let in 2 million muslems that believe that being Gay is a sin and disagree with the law of the land and still believe Theocratic principles then you are lowering the liberty of your country. I dont think the state has to be the opressive force for the action to be anti liberty.', \"I'm so in favour of liberty that I don't want anyone elses opinion on the matter to be relevant\", \"Children do not all end up like their parents so of course that wouldn't even solve the problem if you tried it. The real solution is to question the beliefs of immigrants to make sure that the ones who are allowed to come and live here are people who believe strongly in the idea of personal liberty and small government. I'll gladly invite libertyminded immigrants to move to my country.\", \"Libertarianism is for open borders bud. No, it isn't. You somehow need to come up with a convoluted view where property rights don't exist in the country in either private or collective form in order to support open borders. Nobody has the right to cross a border and transit illegally through private property that's quite a libertarian position. Similarly, any property ownedmanaged by a collective as should be the case with what are now public lands has the same rights under libertarian principles. Besides the sound ideology behind it, there is the practical aspect of this, which many of you ignore as if you're living in an ideal utopia. An open border in a libertarian utopia in your mind, because libertarianism doesn't promise utopia would result it a majority that would vote or revolt to destroy it. What, you think 100s of millions of people coming into the country would not be interested in removing property protections they won't be enjoying Or do you think that once they witness the glory of this utopia, they'll instantly adopt your ideology So let's set an example for you, and tell me where it deviates from libertarian principles. A group of individual land owners forms a collective voluntarily we'll call a town or county that sets rules on who may enter, access, or use the property they set aside for collective use. This collective has set parliamentary procedures to decide what criteria they set, and hire a police department to enforce these rules. They obviously also decide how they'll pay for the collective use infrastructure and the police.

Those libertarians seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production, or else to restrict their purview or effects to usufruct property norms, in favor of common or cooperative ownership and management, viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty. Leftlibertarianism, also known as egalitarian libertarianism, leftwing libertarianism or social libertarianism, is a political philosophy and type of libertarianism that stresses both individual freedom and social equality. Leftlibertarianism represents several related yet distinct approaches to political and social theory. In its classical usage, it refers to antiauthoritarian varieties of leftwing politics such as anarchism, especially social anarchism, whose adherents simply call it libertarianism. In the United States, it represents the leftwing of the libertarian movement and the political positions associated with academic philosophers Hillel Steiner, Philippe Van Parijs and Peter Vallentyne that combine selfownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources. This is done to distinguish libertarian views on the nature of property and capital, usually along leftright or socialistcapitalist lines. While maintaining full respect for personal property, leftlibertarians are opposed to capitalism and the private ownership of the means of production. Other leftlibertarians are skeptical of, or fully against, private ownership of natural resources, arguing in contrast to rightlibertarians that neither claiming nor mixing ones labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and maintain that natural resources should be held in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively. Those leftlibertarians who support private property do so under different property norms and theories such as mutualism, or under the condition that recompense is offered to the local or even global community such as the SteinerVallentyne school. Marketoriented leftlibertarianism, including PierreJoseph Proudhons mutualism and Samuel Konkin IIIs agorism, appeals to leftwing concerns such as class, egalitarianism, environmentalism, gender, immigration and sexuality within the paradigm of freemarket anticapitalism. Although libertarianism in the United States has become associated to classical liberalism and minarchism, with rightlibertarianism being more known than leftlibertarianism, political usage of the term until then was associated exclusively with anticapitalism, libertarian socialism and social anarchism and in most parts of the world such an association still predominates.', 'deleted', 'Government police are not needed for that.

I personally have never felt strong enough about one political party to identify as a Rep, Dem or Lib. I despise the 2 party system and agree with many that it is destroying America. However, I also feel that Trump is an immediate danger to our country. He has managed to pass some things that are good but the way that he feeds off of misinformation, division and hate I can't tolerate that. My mother and I live in two totally different worlds she is a Trump supporter. Recently, I mentioned that I had seen videos of Proud Boys beating people up in the streets and her response was I think they should have been out there from the beginning. That isn't the first thing that has alarmed me that my mother has said about violence committed by the right yes, the left does their fair share and I feel it is a change in her that scares me that she is okay with violence committed by her side but condemns or looks down on any kind of protest or riot on the left. If he is reelected, I will be 32 years old when he leaves office and some would say if he leaves and I will be thinking about bringing a child into the world at that point. That means 4 more years of lying, 4 more years of environmental deregulation and denial of climate change, 4 more years of divisive rhetoric aimed at demonizing democrats. I understand the principle of voting 3rd party and agree with it but I will most likely be voting Democrat for the first time this election, especially with the SCOTUS seat potentially on the table.\", \"I support anyone voting for anyone.

For more than a dozen years now, the Gallup Poll has been using two questions to categorize respondents by ideology Some people think the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses. Others think that government should do more to solve our countrys problems. Which comes closer to your own view Some people think the government should promote traditional values in our society. Others think the government should not favor any particular set of values. Which comes closer to your own view Combining the responses to those two questions, Gallup found the ideological breakdown of the public shown below. With these two broad questions, Gallup consistently finds about 20 percent of respondents to be libertarian, and the number has been rising. They do not go ask every voter if they are libertarian. So basically if you say the government should stay out of business and values, they count you as libertarian. Which even on its face doesn't seem accurate. But then you see The Gallup Poll has a new estimate of the number of libertarians in the American electorate. In their 2015 Governance survey they find that 27 percent of respondents can be characterized as libertarians, the highest number it has ever found. The latest results also make libertarians the largest group in the electorate, as compared to 26 percent conservative, 23 percent liberal, and 15 percent populist. According to Gallup libertarians are the largest part of the electorate. In that sense they should win every election. One problem is defining libertarian. Libertarians can't even decide what a libertarian is. People say Rand Paul is a libertarian, but he's clearly a republican. So there is some confusion over the big L Libertarian and little l libertarian but also over what little l libertarian, or philosophical libertarians even are. I'm sure there are other variables in this but I'm not quick to believe libertarians lead the electorate.\", \"voters who self identified This is where you're wrong.

Trump properties had black tenants. 2. Fred Trump was accused by 3 of 43 accusers, across 14k apartments, per the DoJ lawsuit. 3. Zero accusations were made against Donald Trump. 4. The Trump Companies instituted affirmative action policies in renting in 1975. 5. By 1977, the 10 affirmative action minimum requirement was exceeded. 6. DOJ eventually closed the case for lack of evidence or new complaints. I am also not claiming that any of this proves or disproves anything.

He was patronized as a portrait painter by the court of The Hague.2 Contents 1 Life 2 Work 3 References 4 External links Life Cels was born in Lier in the Duchy of Brabant in 1778. His family was one of the prominent families in Lier. He initially studied under the sculptor Pompe and then under P.J. Denis. He later went to study under the Antwerp painter Andries Cornelis Lens who had settled in Brussels and was then very successful. He studied under Lens from 1795 to 1800.1 He travelled to Paris in September 1800 where he worked for a while under fellow Flemish painter JosephBenot Suve, a Classicist painter. He then travelled on to Italy where he visited Florence and Naples and then settled in Rome where he remained for seven years. While in Rome, he sent his painting Cincinnatus current location unknown to the competition of the Academy of Ghent in 1802 where it won the golden prize.3 One of his works a Descent from the Cross St. Paul's Church, Antwerp in the Pantheon in Rome.1 He had been commissioned to paint the work as replacement for works by Rubens, which had been confiscated by the French occupiers.4 This work was so admired that he was immediately admitted as member and professor of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca in Rome.1 During his residence in Rome he painted many other commissions from Catholic institutions in Flanders and the Netherlands for religious works to replace paintings that had been lost to the French plunder.1 He returned to Flanders and lived and worked in Antwerp until 1815. That year he moved to The Hague, the administrative centre of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands of which the Southern Netherlands had become a part in 1815. Here he enjoyed the patronage of the royal court and was frequently commissioned to paint portraits of the royal family as well as other prominent sitters. He was admitted as a member of the Academy of Antwerp, the Academy of Amsterdam and correspondent of the Institut Nerlandais.1 He was appointed in 1820 to the professorship of drawing and director at the Acadmie des BeauxArts de Tournai Academy of Fine Arts, Tournai, positions he held until he resigned in 1827. He subsequently settled in Brussels, where he resided until his death except for a trip to England in 1836.1 He was the father of JeanMichel Cels, a landscape painter, and Josse Cels, an architect, who were trained by their father.2 Work Cornelis was a painter of religious subjects as well as portraits. He also produced a few genre paintings. His work was influenced by the NeoClassicist style becoming prevalent at the end of the 18th century. His masters Lens and Suve were both representatives of this style in Flanders.2 Portrait of Aryna van der Pot Portrait of Jessy Macpherson Swiss farm girl Portrait of the painter PierreFranois Jacobs fr References Adolphe Siret, Corneille Cels at the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 3, pp. 403405 in French Cornelis Cels at the Netherlands Institute for Art History in Dutch Livin Armand Marie De Bast, Annales du salon de Gand et de l'cole moderne des PaysBas Recueil de morceaux choisis parmi les ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, architecture et gravure, exposs au Muse en 1820, P.

He couldn't turn the United States government fascist in 4 years but he's done a damn good job of corrupting every institution in that direction. He's basically used Umberto Eco's 14 Points of Fascism as a roadmap. I mean, c'mon 1. The Cult of Tradition, characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by Tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement. 2. The Rejection of modernism, which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system. 3. The Cult of Action for Action's Sake, which dictates that action is of value in itself, and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with antiintellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science. 4. Disagreement Is Treason Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith. 5. Fear of Difference, which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants. 6. Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class, fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups. 7. Obsession with a Plot and the hypingup of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society such as the German elite's 'fear' of the 1930s Jewish populace's businesses and welldoings see also antiSemitism. Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession. 8. Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as at the same time too strong and too weak. On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will. 9. Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy because Life is Permanent Warfare there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war. 10. Contempt for the Weak, which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the ingroup. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate Leader who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force. 11. Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero, which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, the UrFascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death. 12. Machismo, which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality. 13. Selective Populism The People, conceived monolithically, have a Common Will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the Leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will though truly he dictates it. Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of no longer representing the Voice of the People. 14. Newspeak Fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning. Which box does Trump not check How about Jason Stanley's the Yale professor who literally wrote the book How Fascism Works characterization He defines fascism as a cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation. Trump is fascist by any reasonable modern day definition. Trying to argue he isn't because he isn't rounding up political enemies to kill yet is headinthesand naive. He's encouraging all kinds of violence, by police and by his supporters. He gleefully cheers on police violence as retribution. He defends vigilantes when they attack his political enemies. He's tried to employ the military. He's sent in DHS forces in unmarked to abduct people off the street. His AG is pressuring his prosecutors to charge protesters with sedition. He's encouraging his brownshirt supporters to violently engage with protesters in an almost eerie recreation of Hitler's brownshirts. Fascism is happening in America.\", \"Yep, unfortunately I don't see another way forward. This ideological purity and focus on the Presidency certainly isn't it.

Signalling to everyone nothing needs to be done.\", 'you seem to think Trump is the best option then Seeing as this is a libertarian subreddit, I think the libertarian candidate is the best option. Crazy hunh', \"They're probably voting for Trump and trying to justify that you're in the wrong for voting for Biden.\", \"Never been a big fan of Ventura, and even if I was. He's definitely in the wrong on this one. No nation has the right to violate the sovereignty of another's outside of acts of selfdefense Pearl Harbor WW2. I don't like it when America does it, I certainly don't like it when another country does it to us. With that said, I was far more interested in the Jill Stein one. As I would have voted for her if Gary Johnson wasn't in the race last election.\", 'deleted', 'Them going bankrupt means there isnt enough demand for them. Lockdowns artificially lower demand. If the government shuts your demand down, you should be compensated for that, no', 'I agree on bump stocks and corporate bailouts however a bailout and a loan are 2 different things. I would agree with you wholeheartedly about corporate bailouts in legitimately any other time in human history except now. The prospect of allowing hundreds of employers to all go under at once could have potentially spelled the end of our republic as we know it. However I totally agree that in any other circumstance the government should stay out of bailing businesses out. Again during coronavirus Id rather see a loan program paid back with high interest rates.', 'Dude Idk what you guys dont get Ive said repeatedly Im against the ban on bump stocks', 'Happy to hear it', \"Voting for democrats will hopefully replace Trump with Biden which is what I'd consider doing something.\", 'I mean I agree we have a long way to go, I just dont think that progress will happen in the next 4 years but I do think people have gotten desensitized to Trumps actions so I do think it could at least give us a buffer presidency and give everyone 4 years to regroup, politics in the US are a mess now and I know Biden wont do great things, but we have time and hopefully a Biden presidency will at least reset the standards for American politics, even if its a bit lower than Id like its better than where were at now in my opinion', 'Theres no chance of a libertarian winning the presidency this year and you know that', 'Theyre PrObABlY voting for Trump Link to where I said I was voting for Trump dumbfuck.', 'I dont know if theres anything with her supporting Putin, but she clearly got support from him. Third party candidates cannot help you, they dont have power to do anything except fog up the results of an election. Thats why people that want to fuck up elections are the only ones that provide them support.', 'Or you create a powerful activist group of dedicated voters and then come to the primary and change one of the two. If you cant, then you cant.', \"Don't you love in the land of choices and options that you have to pick 1 of 2 dickheads to lead the nation for 4 years\", 'Except most businesses werent compensated', 'Thats not what happened. Massive bailouts occurred, not loans. Also, yes, the unemployment rate will increase, but the positive effects would be shown in the long run.', \"Yeah, but you and everybody else weren't angry enough at it to sue. So that means it's now a power of the executive branch.\", 'Continuing America on the march toward authoritarianism Electing another pedophile for you to fantasize about What lofty goals. Do you think your vote will actually have an impact on it though Seems pretty deluded, if so.', 'Getting 5 of the vote is still important then the party can get FEC funding.', \"I said probably which means you didn't say it. If you said it then it wouldn't be probable, it would be known. Inference is middle school level reading comprehension so I won't blame you for not picking up on it.\", \"You're making a point here with which I can agree, in that government just cannot properly assign the resources. It's too centrally planned to do so. I don't know what a more decentralized approach to the issue would look like. Maybe the fed granting the money to the states, which then divides it among the counties, to get a more local and direct control over the funds could be a solution.\", 'Yes i agree Im saying that it shouldve been structured as a loan. Also under normal circumstances I have a Darwinian survival of the fittest attitude about business. If a struggling business goes under due to their own negligence and inefficiency this opens market space for more efficient competitors to take their place thereby improving the market. However when a black swan event such as covid forces even efficiently run businesses into bankruptcy i believe this hurts the market more than helps. Now there is a case to be made that they should have been prepared balance sheet wise to handle such a crisis. Overall like I said I oppose massive bailouts and wouldve preferred to see a massive loan out of you will.', 'Continuing America on the march toward authoritarianism Biden is arguably much less authoritarian than Trump so no not really.
